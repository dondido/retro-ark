The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards.

The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.

The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.\n\nCaptain Planet and the Planeteers is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: Inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose a defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out to the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. \n\nInside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.","rating":"0.3","releasedate":"19920902T000000","genre":"Platform","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"1421","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Captain Silver","name":"Captain Silver","desc":"In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.\n\nThere are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word \"CAPTAIN SILVER\". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.\n\nJim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the \"clock\" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the \"boot\" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the \"coffee?\" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.\n\nThere is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires.

The one caveat is that your dude has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, you have to bounce across a paint can (an attitude converter) that will change your dude to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.

There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp.

There's no turning back now.\n\nSpike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.\n\nGet going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you.

I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary \"work people\" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the game√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earth√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime.

This port is often considered to be much worse than those two, suffering from poor programming, controls and collision detection, as well as numerous other flaws. The story was completely omitted from this game, apart from an ending being present. Upon starting the game the player is given the option to start on any of the 8 levels that this game has.\nAll of the levels are based off those from the original game. The controls are awkward, with the player having to press Select to throw apples. The hit detection is poor, with attacks that clearly hit the enemy not registering much of the time. The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.\n\nThe graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a \"The End\" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.","genre":"Platform","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"124467","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Alfombra Magica, La","name":"Magic Carpet 1001","desc":"Magic Carpet 1001 (called \"Arabian Nights\" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.\nThe game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.\nAs well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.\nOddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.\nThis game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.","genre":"Shoot'em Up / Horizontal","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"99396","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Alfred Chicken","name":"Alfred Chicken","desc":"Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens.

When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. \n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up.

Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the \"Konamic\" appellation; a portmanteau of \"Konami\" and \"dynamic\". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.\n\nKonamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.\n\nOne feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.","releasedate":"19880819T000000","genre":"Sports / Tennis","players":"1-2","lang":"en","id":"98653","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Koneko Monogatari - The Adventures of Chatran","name":"Koneko Monogatari - The Adventures Of Chatran","desc":"Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986 by Pony Canyon and the NES in 1987.

There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area.

The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.\n\nThroughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.\n\nAll of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.

This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.\n\nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.\n\nAfter the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.\n\nThird phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. \n\nThere are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:\n- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.\n- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.\n- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).\n- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.\n- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.\n- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.\n- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.\n- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.\n\nM.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. \n\nM.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.","rating":"0.5","releasedate":"19900901T000000","genre":"Strategy","players":"1-4","lang":"en","id":"18737","platform":"nes"},{"path":"M.U.S.C.L.E.","name":"M.U.S.C.L.E. : Tag Team Match","desc":"M.U.S.C.L.E.

Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.\nThe game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.\nAs well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health.

The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.\nThe game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.\nThere are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.\nOn two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.","releasedate":"19860808T000000","genre":"Platform","players":"1-2","lang":"en","id":"71463","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Mutant Virus, The","name":"The Mutant Virus : Crisis in a Computer World","desc":"In The Mutant Virus you play the part of Ron Trainer, the best of the best at the elite corps of Computer Master Debuggers.

Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling.

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.","releasedate":"19911213T000000","genre":"Puzzle / Fall","players":"1-2","lang":"en","id":"71545","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Tetsudou Ou - Famicom Boardgame","name":"Tetsudou Ou - Famicom Boardgame","desc":"This is a board-game title in which 4 players play as rail road cars.

The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.\n\nThe graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a \"The End\" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.","genre":"Platform","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"124467","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Aladdin 3","name":"Aladdin III","desc":"A hack of Magic Carpet 1001.

The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.\nRocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.\nThe first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.","rating":"0.6","genre":"Platform","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"88528","platform":"nes"},{"path":"RONG FENG Study Cartridge","name":"RONG FENG Study Cartridge","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"ROOMS","name":"ROOMS","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Roulette","name":"Roulette","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Russia","name":"Russia","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Sailor Fuku Bishoujo Zukan","name":"Sailor Fuku Bishoujo Zukan","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Sampled Sound Test","name":"ZZZ(notgame):#NONGAME","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"175790","platform":"nes"},{"path":"San Guo Da Luan Dou Zhan Guo (Orochi)","name":"San Guo Da Luan Dou Zhan Guo (Orochi)","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"San Guo Wu Shuang - Meng Jiang Zhuan","name":"San Guo Wu Shuang - Meng Jiang Zhuan","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"San Guo Zhi - Ao Shi Tian Di","name":"San Guo Zhi - Ao Shi Tian Di","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"San Guo Zhi - Cao Cao Zhuan","name":"San Guo Zhi - Cao Cao Zhuan","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"San Guo Zhong Lie Zhuan","name":"San Guo Zhong Lie Zhuan","desc":"Also known as The Story of Three Kingdoms.

The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.\nRocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.\nThe first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.","rating":"0.6","genre":"Platform","players":"1","lang":"en","id":"88528","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Rules to Driving the Car (Russian) [!]","name":"Rules to Driving the Car (Russian) [!]","genre":"Misc","players":"1","lang":"en","platform":"nes"},{"path":"Shisen Mahjang - Seifuku Hen (Regular Edition) (Joy Van)","name":"Mahjong Trap - Si Cuan Ma Que","desc":"One of several Mahjong solitaire games released by Sachen.
