The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.",

After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.\n\nThe player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each \"mission\" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.\n\nOnce in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.\n\nThe player must also locate an item of \"historical bait,\" appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.",

From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players.

The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.",

During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word \"CAPTAIN SILVER\". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.\n\nJim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the \"clock\" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the \"boot\" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the \"coffee?\" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.\n\nThere is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round.

If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.\n\nAll of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. \n\nThere are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:\n\n1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.\n\n2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:\n\n1. 14.1 Challenge – After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.\n\n2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.\n\n3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.\n\n4. Equal Offence – Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.\n\n5. Three Pool – Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.\n\n6. Speed Pool – Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).\n\n3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:\n\n1. Eight Ball (2 Players)  – A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.\n\n7. Nine Ball (2-8 Players)  – A standard nine ball game with up to 8 players taking turns.

Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.\n\n10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  – Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.\n\n11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  –  Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.\n\n12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)  –  Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.\n\n13. Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.\n\n14. One Pocket (2 Players)  – The two players are given one of the two pockets at the end of the table.

For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.",

To get very far, you have to use your power-ups: TURBO for better acceleration, FIRE for more firepower, SPEED for faster speed, MISSILE to fire both missiles and bullets, and FORCE which lets you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You have about one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels, each with different objectives. The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels, 25 in total. The later levels are much more difficult than the first ones.

In most versions, the player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the planet's defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the planet.\nWhen designing the Famicom version of the game, Toshiba EMI took the system's capabilities, as well as it younger market audience, in to account. The game has been considerably simplified compared to its computer counterparts. Before starting an action sequence, the player is allowed to place three power-ups along a map of the stage. When the player reaches these designated locations, the specified power-up will fall from the sky for the player to collect. The game concludes when the player locates and conquers two specific planets; the Vuritora manufacturing planet, and Nirsartia.",

To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.\n\nThe second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.\n\nThe third mode is Aerobics Studios.

This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept \"requests\" from the non-player characters. These are optional tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when finished.",

There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.",

While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents.

You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.\n\nDragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. \n\nYou begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.\n\nThe game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.",

But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night\n\nIn fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots.

First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.\n\nA race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.",

One such book, titled \"How To Make Watching Pro Baseball Ten Times More Fun,\" is where this game derives its name. Besides Emoyan, the game uses fictional players and team names.\n\nThe game has a heavier sim aspect than most baseball sims for the Famicom, with players choosing a spot on a grid to both bat and pitch towards, the idea being to predict the ball's movement or the batter's likelihood of reaching it. Fielding is performed automatically.",

Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: \"Children! Find the Time Crown!\". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!\n\n\"Erika & Satoru\" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.",

In addition, Mamoru can bring along a friend (one per world and controlled by the CPU) who can assist him while battling and give him clues about where to go next. Mamoru can also carry healing items with him, for a quick boost of energy when he's running low.\n\nThe game ends when Mamoru's HP reaches 0 - or when you have saved the Book Worlds.",

Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.\n\n\n\nIn order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.\n\n\n\nAs the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.",

An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple.

First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is \"Cosmos Mode\", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however.

Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.\n\nThe second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.\n\nThe third mode is Aerobics Studios.

While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.",

After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. \n\nThis may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.\n\nThe player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.\n\nOther helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.",

Goemon's friend Ebisumaru offers to help him to find out the criminal, and both embark on a journey full of adventures and danger.\n\nLike most console-style RPGs of the time, \"Goemon Gaiden\" utilizes a simple turn-based battle system.

The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. \n\nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. \n\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.",

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.\n\nBy avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.\n\nAll versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.",

From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for \"ghost alarms\" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.",

On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.\n\nSpike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.\n\nSpike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons.

Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.\nBeware Godzilla!",

The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball.

Nintendo banked upon the movie’s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.\n\nYou play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn’t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!\n\nUpon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.\n\nThere is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.",

It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages.\nThe game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will\nget the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.",

Two versions of the game were originally released, both with title screens in English and Chinese - however, both also feature cutscenes written entirely in English. Harry's Legend has become an object of multiple unofficial rereleases, appearing on both multicarts and single game cartridges.\n\nIn comparison to Titenic, the gameplay has been somewhat dumbed down. Harry Potter, the only playable character, has got only three non-special attacks: non-comboable standing kick, crouching punch and crouching kick - which means he can't attack while in the air. The inputs for both special attacks remain the same, however, one of them, the broom projectile, isn't available until level two, while the second, the sparkling magic projectile, is only usable since level three.\n\nThere are five levels present in Harry's Legend, all of which can be chosen right after the title screen, although all of them have to be completed in order to see the ending. The majority of level layouts have been brought over from Titenic with a few differences in graphics and item placements.\n\nIn addition to that, most of the enemies make a return from Titenic, albeit none of them do proper attacks, going for contact damage instead. A few of them, like the animals, don't sport any changes whatsoever, while the human enemies were edited to not handle guns. The only all-new enemies in Harry's Legend are a giant chess piece and an indestructible floating flame. Even though a book-holding ghost also appears in level five, he can't do any damage to Harry normally, and is only here to bounce off the ball.\n\nEach stage ends with a boss - possibly based on professor Quirrel and Voldemort - who has two faces and is constanly walking backwards. Strangely, his death animation always has him fall right down into water, even if it doesn't make sense from the stage's design.\n\nThe first segment of stage five, At School, features a volleyball minigame, in which Harry plays against an old lady, and either takes damage by letting the ball into his goal, or does damage to the lady if it gets into her goal.",

The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.\n\nHello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.\n\nThroughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.",

It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\".\nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.\nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.",

				"desc": "Hissatsu Shigotonin roughly translates to Deadly Work People. I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary \"work people\" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the gameâ€™s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. Iâ€™m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japanâ€™s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earthâ€™s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.",

Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. \n\nThough scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.",

Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the \"game over\" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.",

				"desc": "Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987. \n\nPrior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to \"Connect Four\" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.",

Beware: 8 levels of \nisometric death await.\n\nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.",

Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district. There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain amount of net worth, then return to the bank. Up to four players can play at once, with computer players filling in any empty slots. There are 7 different characters and five different board layouts to choose from.",

The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the \"3D mode\" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.",

However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.\n\nPool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.\n\nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also \"multi-class\" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.\n\nThe NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it.

In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.\n\nThe game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.",

				"path": "./Aladdin II.7z",
				"name": "Aladdin 2",
				"desc": "Like Aladdin by Super Game, this game is a port of the Mega Drive version of Aladdin. This port is often considered to be much worse than those two, suffering from poor programming, controls and collision detection, as well as numerous other flaws. The story was completely omitted from this game, apart from an ending being present. Upon starting the game the player is given the option to start on any of the 8 levels that this game has.\nAll of the levels are based off those from the original game. The controls are awkward, with the player having to press Select to throw apples. The hit detection is poor, with attacks that clearly hit the enemy not registering much of the time. The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.\n\nThe graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a \"The End\" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.",

				"desc": "Magic Carpet 1001 (called \"Arabian Nights\" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.\nThe game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.\nAs well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.\nOddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.\nThis game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.",

To make things a little more difficult, the grappling hook can only be launched from a diagonal direction and not just straight above.",

The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.\n\nThis game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels (\"classes\") and become stronger.",

Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy.

If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. \n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.",

In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.\n\nStreet running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).",

The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.\n\nThe Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. \n\nThe player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.\n\nScoring\n\nClose-in goals - 1 point\nGoals near Goldbeams - 2 points\nOTH shots - 3 points\nPlayers may steal points from each other by making goals. \nThe total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.\nA player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.",

Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank is cooked!",

The most notable difference is that multiple weapons can be used. Each ship carries a special weapon that can fire many missiles many points across a set grid, for instance in an X pattern.

Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.\n\nSome levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.",

Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.\nThe plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack.\nA unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level.\nThe game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.",

Yasuko Tomita served as the model of one of the characters.

Neary every house and building can be entered, which was unique for its time. The game also features a high degree of freedom, allowing you to visit restaurants for a bite, or a Dojo to train, or to hunt for vegetation to sell for money, while you are looking for the princess.\n\nAnother introduced concept that was novel for its time was the notion of day and night changing the appearance of the city. During the evening, you may encounter a street gang, and they may open fire on you, although you can defend yourself with a revolver. However, if over 20 innocent people are gunned down, you will be arrested and sent to the police station where you must pay a fine and return to the starting point.\n\nThe degree of difficult throughout the game is considered quite high, with very few hints to help you out, while other hints are misleading. For example, one hint suggests that you if you sleep over night at a particular crossroad in a city, you will get a key item, but this hint is false.

Cook. \n\nIf Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. \n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.",

Consecutively creating several holes results in a chain increasing the player's score in differing increments.\n\nAt the beginning of each \"round\", a heart is placed somewhere on the board. A heart (or multiple hearts) must be collected to advance to the next round, which thereby replaces all holes on the board with new white squares and places a new heart somewhere on the board. Depending on the game mode, hearts will sometimes move themselves every few jumps of the knight.\n\nThe player can also gather a small amount of extra points, at any time, by holding the A button and speeding up the knight's movement. The main objective in Knight Move is to continue this cycle, despite the increasing game speed, and reach the highest score possible.\n\nThe game also includes a simultaneous 2 player versus mode similar to the single player modes.",

Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the \"Konamic\" appellation; a portmanteau of \"Konami\" and \"dynamic\". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.\n\nKonamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.\n\nOne feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.",

Every moving object from mice to beetles, is lethal to Milo and must be avoided. Fruit can be dropped on enemies for extra points. Eggs can be collected to use as weapons which must be dropped on enemies. Bottles of milk grant temporary invincibility. And if the player manages to collect four eggs that spell out the word HELP, Otis will appear to attack enemies that are headed Milo's way. However, touching Otis will also kill Milo..",

They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).\n\nIt's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.\n\nHowever, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?\n\nKyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.\n\nBy pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.\n\nAll seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.",

There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.\n\nThroughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.\n\nAll of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.",

The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.\n\nLegacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.\n\nThe object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.",

Timon has the slowest speed, but he can swim without an oxygen limit and uses tomatoes as his weapon.

				"name": "M.U.L.E.",
				"desc": "M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.\n\nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.\n\nAfter the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.\n\nThird phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. \n\nThere are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:\n- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.\n- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.\n- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).\n- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.\n- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.\n- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.\n- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.\n- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.\n\nM.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. \n\nM.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.",

Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. \n\nThe Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. \n\nWhile Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.",

				"desc": "Magic Carpet 1001 (called \"Arabian Nights\" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.\nThe game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.\nAs well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.\nOddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.\nThis game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.",

So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.\n\nThe game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.\n\nAfter each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.\n\nAfter the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.\n\nThe two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.",

West Tako Cheerleading Squad\") is a Famicom strategy game based on the manga of the same name about a young man who joins his school's intimidating cheerleading squad. In 1987, this same property also saw a live-action movie adaptation.\n\nThe game has players moving characters around a city map and fighting rival ouendan teams for dominance. Combat occurs whenever two units meet on the map and cuts to a timing-based mini-game where the player has to input a command before their opponent's fist reaches the current character's profile. The closer the fist gets, the more likely it is that the enemy gets in their attack before the player can. Stronger attacks are listed further down the menu, increasing the risk vs. reward factor as the player scrambles to execute them in time.\n\nAfter winning a map, the player's party can gain levels and acquire new special attacks, which show up in the attack menu on rare occasions and are very powerful.",

Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).",

In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.\n\nThis game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.\n\nFurther, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.",

However, once the player receives the ship for sailing, the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can be reached.\nAnother unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to exchange blows.

The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent.

The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.\nThe game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.\nThere are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.\nOn two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.",

Throughout the game, you will do your best to improve your statistics in six categories: knowledge, health, friendship, love, popularity and wealth. You will be ranked among the Japanese population to see how well you are doing in six categories. Japan has a population of 130 million. You will then start at #130,000,000 and try to get to #1. The entire course is very long. You can expect to play it for about 50 hours, and that's as long as you win on the first try. You will not do this on your own. Reaching #1 in the ranking is not easy.",

Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure.\nPero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery.\nLoosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean, Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features \"death water,\" a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance.\nThis game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.",

Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the \"game over\" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.",

To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the \"E\" indicates the exit.\n\nYour mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.\n\nMore often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?",

They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.\n\nBut soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.\n\nThere is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the \"Red Warrior\", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.\n\nNazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.",

It is also much more linear: You fight through the castles one after the other, with each stage consisting of the path to the castle and the castle itself, where the boss is waiting.\n\nYour have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.",

You can even substitute second-stringers for the \"skill\" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.\n\nPlay perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.\n\nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout \"First Down!\" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.

The obstacles in the game are electric bolts, electric sparks, disappearing blocks, a homing missile system, and of course, time. If you run out of time on a certain level, the game is over. If you get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the point where you picked up the last virus. It's a pretty simple concept overall. I tried to cover everything in the tutorial, but I did in fact miss the part about respawning at the last picked up virus. Oh well, things happen!",

Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).\n\nNightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted \"real world,\" players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a \"sleep meter\" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted \"dream world,\" where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.\n\nPlayers can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become \"Dream Warriors\" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.\n\nNightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.",

				"desc": "The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! \"Lettuce check it out,\" urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. \"I yam King Kale,\" he says, \"Won't you peas peas help me?\" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.\n\nIt seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and \"vegetable-themed\" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.\n\nOur two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.",

				"desc": "In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. \n\nJajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.\n\nIn each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.\n\nAs the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a \"boss\". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.\n\nItems can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.\n\nThe items in this game are:\n\n1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.\n\n2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!\n\n3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.\n\n4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.\n\n5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.\n2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!\n\n6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.\n\n7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.",

The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.\nBefore getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.",

However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.\n\nUnlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be \"average\" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of \"dog catches cat; cat catches fish\" - emulating the food chain.",

				"desc": "Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. \n\nAs the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four \"buffer\" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.\n\nTo make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.\n\nThe player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.\n\nBlood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.",

It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.\n\nTwo modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. \n\nMode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile.

Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.\n\nThis game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. \n\nIn the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.\n\nThe alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.\n\nDrawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.",

The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.\n\nFinally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.",

Pikachu can take three hits before losing a life, with the amount of hits left represented by a Pokéball counter on the top right corner of the screen. There are a total of four worlds (Velbt, Woods, Tableland and Motte) which are split into three levels each, as well as a single-screen boss battle at the end of each. The background graphics are mostly ripped and slightly modified from Athena and Adventure Island II. Some of the enemies are also taken from various games, with some of them based off Pokémon. The music is seemingly original despite having the sound engine ripped from Konami games while the sound effects are taken directly from those games. The ending is Pikachu dancing with an \"End\" message at the top of the screen.",

Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.\n\nAccidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game.

Contrary to popular belief, Tyson was not removed because of his rape conviction (which did not occur until a year after the changeover), but because his contract expired. Since he had lost the title to James \"Buster\" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler.\nDue to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that. While Mr. Dream can't use \"flooring punches\" forever, his punches are quick, his reaction time is top-notch, and he's also a difficult opponent to fight. The pass code to fight him is 007 373 5963.",

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game.

He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.\n\n2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.\n\n3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.\n\n4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.\n\nAll of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.",

In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must \"fight\" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.\nThe game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.",

They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.\n\nReplicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.\n\nThe conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage.

During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.\n\nControlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.\n\nAdditionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different \"worlds\" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.",

Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a \"puzzle-solving\" atmosphere.\n\nPlayers score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.",

Several features that weren't present in any other fighting games on Famicom were included: a 'rage' gauge that may be refilled by holding BW+A and performing a super move when it's fully charged; three-tiered health bar; and, finally, the 'conquest' mode, where you have to eliminate all of your opponent's fortresses in order to win.\n\nThe game has six playable characters, with every of them selectable from the beginning (from left to right): Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Cao Ren, Mei Ya [?] and Lu Bu. However, during the 'conquest' mode, there are two more characters that are not playable the regular way: Shi Ren and Xie Seng. Both of them are slightly overpowered but have only two tiers of health at the very beginning.\n\nIn the 'arcade' mode, the player should defeat all six opponents (including his clone) in a specified order. Only nine continues are available for this type of game.\n\n'Conquest' mode, in its' turn, proposes the player to choose one of two preset teams, with each having three characters. After the choice is done, the player has to decide which enemy's fortress he should siege. Once the fortress is selected, the attacker's staying on his own, while the defending side has Shi Ren, Xie Seng and the actual \"defender\" (stage \"owner\") appearing in the same defined order, King of Fighters style. Should only the attacker defeat one of the opponents, his health's being fully restored. Once all three opponent's fortresses fall, the player wins.",

Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice. It was, however, possible to trick the computer into trapping itself against obstacles on the right maps.",

You challenge me? I see. Very well then. I accept your challenge. However, you will never win!\"nnSeiken Psycho Calibur: Maju no Mori Densetsu is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System, developed by Imagineer and published in 1987. It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.\nSeiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.\nFor example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.",

When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.",

Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master). The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.",

Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.\n\nSilver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter \"F\" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter \"S\" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.",

She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine. However, she soon finds out that the doctor is unable to help her, due to having had his eight treasures stolen from him by demons. Sylviana vows to return the treasures to him in exchange for the medicine.\nThe game borrows it's combat system from games like Hydlide and Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished, where damage is inflicted upon (and exchanged with) enemies by crashing into them. However, there are no levels or experience points, so Sylviana's power only grows by virtue of the improved equipment that she purchases or finds. Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure. Eventually, the player enters a cave and steps through a mirror to enter the mirror image of the original world map, with increased difficulty.",

In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.\n\nThe ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.\n\nBart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.",

Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.\n\nThe plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon.

Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.",

Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...\n\nSquare no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.",

Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.\n\nYour mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.\n\nThe game can be played by one or two player taking turns.

The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.\n\nPlaying as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.\n\nAs in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.",

In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.\n\nA player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the \"What is...\" question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.",

Hudson Soft licensed the rights to bring the game to Nintendo's Famicom, and it was released in 1984 as one of the first 3rd party games ever made for the system and it was an incredible hit. Around the same time, Irem licensed the rights to produce an arcade version of Lode Runner which they also released in 1984, along with three other sequels through 1986. These arcade versions made a few tweaks to the original game play, and the final arcade game introduced a two player cooperative mode.\n\nIn 1987, Irem decided to package a number of select stages from all four of the arcade games into one title, and released it in disk format for the Famicom Disk System, entitled Super Lode Runner. Though the graphics were not quite as good as the arcade games, they were close, and Irem brought many of the game play changes to Famicom players, including the new two player mode. Irem released a sequel later on that same year. A different version of the game was released for the MSX with the same title.",

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\n\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.",

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.",

Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.\n\nEnemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.\n\nHalfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.\n\nEvery mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.\n\nEach mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.",

A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).\n\nSequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.",

Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.\n\nTotally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.",

Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars or Tsuppari Suku mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (\"Struggle\").",

Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.",

The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.\n\nThe overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.\n\nSometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.\n\nThe side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.\n\nThe climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.\n\nIn the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.",

Ultraman 2 was a sequel developed as a simulation game, and Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen was developed as an RPG utilizing the \"chibi\" or super-deformed style of artwork for the characters.\n\nThe player controls Hayate, a member of the Science Special Search Party, which protects the earth from invasions of large hostile aliens. He must run across each stage, defeating enemies with his ray gun. He must also collect energy orbs to fill a meter on the screen. When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.\n\nIf all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.",

Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.\n\nAll of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies.

He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!\n\nThe game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early \"interactive fiction\" adventures.\n\nUshio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game as the SNES action title \"Ushio & Tora\".",

Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row, will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points. Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA. Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.",

Hundreds of years later, a descendant of the king, named Darutos, stumbled upon the location of the wing and decided to use it for his own ends. He summoned demons to take over his family's castle to claim it as solely his own. The remaining Rameru family line now have formed an alliance to gain back the castle and put a stop to Darutos. They decided there only hope is a magic wielding warrior named Lucia.",

Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.",

Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.\n\nThe third game in the Wizards & Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.\n\nThe gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.",

The player's vehicle also has some degree of inertia: There's a slight delay when attempting to accelerate after stopping or performing a U-turn, but if the player keeps moving and changes direction only at 90 degree intervals, they can keep moving at their maximum speed.

Each single screen level (wrapping on both horizontal and vertical axes) consists of an arrangement of platforms and staircases upon which are placed a number of phones and filing cabinets. When a phone rings, the topic that the call is about is represented by a symbol above the handset - and your task is to run to the matching filing cabinet then answer the call before the phone rings off. It starts of simple enough, with day one based on a symmetrical level with only two phones and two cabinets, but the difficulty soon ramps up with devious platform placement and a variety of obstructive NPC's thrown into the mix. The boss slows you down with his unhelpful remarks (just like in real life) and chatting with the office gossip-girl can leave you confused and swap over the topic currently held in your single-track mind. Then there's the delivery guy knocking people over and the oh-so-essential and distracting office romance - although thankfully there is also a coffee machine to provide you with a caffeine-fuelled speed boost to help you overcome all these obstacles. It's a simple yet compulsive concept that would work equally well as a browser-based casual game or modern console indie title, so to see Zooming Secretary make it's debut on the original 'family computer' is particularly exciting.",

In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a \"RPG\" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.\n\nLike The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.\n\nThough it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named \"Team Bioteckers\".

				"desc": "Like Aladdin by Super Game, this game is a port of the Mega Drive version of Aladdin. This port is often considered to be much worse than those two, suffering from poor programming, controls and collision detection, as well as numerous other flaws. The story was completely omitted from this game, apart from an ending being present. Upon starting the game the player is given the option to start on any of the 8 levels that this game has.\nAll of the levels are based off those from the original game. The controls are awkward, with the player having to press Select to throw apples. The hit detection is poor, with attacks that clearly hit the enemy not registering much of the time. The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.\n\nThe graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a \"The End\" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.",

Most of the character roster is being a huge bunch of shotoclones, with one of the few exceptions being Peach, who has Chun-Li's moveset, Koopa, who has some sort of a 'kamikaze' projectile and Donkey Kong who throws a ground projectile, similar to Terry's Power Wave.\n\nThe game has original sprites and music, although some graphics were obviously reused from such games as Little Nemo: The Dream Master and Wario Land 4, not to say about the use of the graphics from Mario games themselves.\n\nLike in many games based on the same engine (along with NES Street Fighter II port by the same developers), this has the two-player mode, apart from the contrary belief, by pressing the A button on the second gamepad during player select sequence.",

The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,\n\nPlayers can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.",

Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).

A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running.

The \"Olympic\" championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: Internacional, Flamengo, São Paulo and Vasco. Each team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.\n\nAfter selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.\n\nThe game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.\n\nPlayers can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.",

Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.\nHang on! This is only round No. 1.

He spent three months inventing a machine called \"Chi Chi Po\" which can automatically trace the dirty garbage in the world. He has also organized and trained a \"Po Po Team\" to collect the garbage. Now, Dr. Po Po Lung, his Chi Chi Po and the Po Po Team are on their way to complete his great project...

				"name": "Rocman X",
				"desc": "Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.\nRocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.\nThe first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.",

The Holy Flame Society, the most persistent of rebel organizations, is being heavily persecuted by the government, and its leader, the Grand Master, has disappeared. The player takes control of the \"Little Master\", who must find allies to strengthen the Holy Flame Society and eventually overthrow the rulers of the country.\n\nConsidered the first major Chinese (Taiwanese)-made role-playing game for a console, Sheng Huo Lie Zhuan (\"Tale of the Holy Flame\") is a rather basic RPG of the Japanese template. The player navigates the hero and subsequently joining party members over the top-down \"world map\", entering towns and other areas represented by icons. In towns, it is possible to rest, chat with the townspeople, and buy supplies. Enemies attack the party randomly. The player must choose which characters to use before every battle. The turn-based engine, menu-based command input, and automatic leveling up are handled the same way as Japanese RPGs of the time.",

Unlike the original arcade game and its licensed port, the game does not feature co-op play, as the players simply take turns. Also missing from the original are the different modes of play (Panic mode and Tour mode).",

				"name": "Rocman X",
				"desc": "Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.\nRocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.\nThe first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.",
