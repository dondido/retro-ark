		<name>Sesame Street : Big Bird's Hide &amp; Speak</name>
		<desc>Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

		<path>./Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit.7z</path>
		<name>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit</name>
		<desc>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up in which the player controls a blue helicopter fighting against waves of enemy vehicles and ground turrets. Each mission takes the helicopter to a different part of the world, each with a distinctive if chromatically plain visual style.

The game's power-ups, available by destroying smaller supply trucks driving across the screen, change the helicopter's weapons but do not make them stronger. It's even possible to collect the weaker original weapon again if the player is too careless. These range from a stronger forward-firing cannon (or laser) to guns that spread fire forwards and to the sides of the helicopter.

You can beat it more than once with enemies taking more hits on subsequent playthroughs.</desc>

		<name>Big Nose the Caveman</name>
		<desc>Long, long time ago (but not necessarily in a galaxy far, far away), there was a caveman named Big Nose. One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. "That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</desc>

		<name>Bikkuriman World - Gekitou Sei Senshi</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Bikkuriman World". Once upon a time, the world was a peaceful place. Three races - Angels, Demons, and Talismans - co-existed in the world, protected by the Holy Goddess Nadia. One day, Nadia sent her twin children into the world. Jura, the head of the Demons, abducted one of the children and devoured it. The other child took refuge by the Angels and soon became their leader, known as Super Zeus. He led the Angels to a victory over the Demons. But Nadia, seeing how her world is being torn apart by the war, split it in two. Years have passed. You are a young hero named Yamato Ouji, raised in the world of the Angels. Super Zeus sends you on a quest to find other Holy Warriors, to re-unite the worlds, and to bring everlasting peace to all the races.

This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your hero from a top-down view on the world map, in towns, and dungeons. The enemies are random and the combat is turn-based, viewed from first-person perspective. You start alone but later you find other heroes who join your party and help you on your quest.</desc>

		<path>./Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure.7z</path>
		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure</name>
		<desc>Bill and Ted are two surfer-speaking 1980s high school dudes from San Dimas, California.  After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.

The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.

Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.

The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.</desc>

The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.</desc>

		<name>Bio Senshi Dan - Increaser Tono Tatakai</name>
		<desc>The year is 2081. The Earth has become a devastated planet, overrun by monsters, controlled by a mysterious entity known as Increaser. The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser – whatever he (or it) is.

The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump &amp; run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</desc>

		<name>Bionic Commando</name>
		<desc>You play a soldier with a bionic arm that extends and contracts.  Your arm allows you to grab on to fixed objects to swing around and climb up levels -- no jumping allowed! The arm also grabs opponents and pull them towards you.

Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy fortress, find your missing comrade, "Super Joe", and take out the evil leader, "Generalissimo Kilt", of the invading force that has been attacking your people for the last 2 years.

After most levels the Bionic Commando will recieve items. Often these items are required to successfully complete other levels. Additionally, each level will require a different colored communicator in order to make sense of message traffic</desc>

The two babies are sitting on a branch, while you fly around and try to catch some butterflies or other things to feed your children.

		<name>Bishoujo Control</name>
		<desc>Combining all the fun of an arcade shoot'em'up with all the excitement of watching pretty girls, Girl's Control puts you in a spaceship, battling hordes of enemies flying downwards. All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for "pretty girl" powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl). 

The gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more "phallic" configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.</desc>

Your task is to photograph pretty girls in various situations. You are given a choice of point-and-shoot, single lens reflex and a pro camera. 
You are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses. Later stages raise the difficulty level, forcing you to use the SLR, and later the meter-less pro camera.</desc>

		<desc>Blade Buster is a new homebrew NES shoot'em up by the doujin group High Level Challenge. The game is based on the two time attack modes from the 1990 Turbografx-16 vertical shoot'em up Super Star Soldier, in which you try to achieve the highest possible score in either 2 or 5 minutes. So there are only two short stages in the game, with the boss battles at the end of each one. Aside from the standard enemies, boxes, and gems, there are various hidden bonuses you can get for extra points.</desc>

		<name>Blades of Steel</name>
		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn't require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options.  From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box.  The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</desc>

You are assigned to find the monster's lair and to defeat it. However, upon your return to the village you find out some people were abducted by the imperial troops. Now you have to find out the Empries's true motives and to solve a grand mystery.

The gameplay in "Bloody Warriors" is similar to  Dragon Quest series: you travel on the world map, fighting random monsters in turn-based, first-person-perspective battles, and visiting towns and dungeons. The major difference is the addition of strategy battles. At certain points you'll have to recruit knights and to fight whole armies of enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Bo Jackson was the first all-star athlete in two major sports, Baseball and American Football. Bo Jackson Baseball is a game about Bo Jackson baseball career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5 – 8 if you wish) innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.

At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons. All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

But Kuro knocked Shiro to the ground, and then left the money so that he would be framed. Now Shiro has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Dynablaster is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

This game introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a recreation of the original Boogerman, but is considerably less faithful than Boogerman II: The Final Adventure, with a mixed-up level order and severely limited abilities for the player, which is compensated for by providing infinite ammo.

Like many of Super Game's other bootlegs, this game has no ending; after the player defeats the third boss, the game merely resets.</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>Bram Stroker's Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</desc>

Each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles.

Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play.  Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts.  A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.  Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.

Burai Fighter uses a slightly different gameplay mechanic when compared to other shooters. You can shoot in 8 directions, and when you hold down the fire button you keep shooting in that direction.</desc>

A lot of strategy is used when players have to make decisions and negotiate. Messages always arrive using the data feed style to make the game more business-like. The game can end with a loss if the wrong decision is made at the wrong time (similar to dying in an action game). The player will have to deal with loan sharks in the Caribbean, ruthless corporate executives from rival companies, arbitration sessions, and components that make the game look more like a strategy game at times. There are no items to use and very little action (with moving the guy around a virtual office building).</desc>

		<name>B-wings</name>
		<desc>B-Wings is based on the popular arcade game Battle Wings. It is a vertically scrolling space shooter that owes its name to the space fighter from  Star Wars movies. You have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal: Fire, Cannons, Jump, Hammer, etc. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.</desc>

		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Cabal is a shooter where the protagonist runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. The player returns fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves the player character and may expose him to enemy fire. 

The enemies throughout the five levels come thick and fast and there are many of them. They include normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses such as submarines and war machines. Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine guns and shotguns. Two-player mode is available.</desc>

Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

		<path>./Captain America and The Avengers.7z</path>
		<name>Captain America and the Avengers</name>
		<desc>The Mandarin has knocked out Iron Man and the Vision. This time it is personal.

You play as Captain America or Hawkeye. In the one player mode, you must fight your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and the Vision. This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In between levels, Wasp gives you hints.

Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.

Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.

If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This has the advantage that Cap's forward charge is powerful and by grabbing poles, he can then jump to areas Hawkeye cannot.

Hawkeye can shoot enemies or targets too high for Cap to jump up and kick.

In the battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys).

You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</desc>

		<name>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</name>
		<desc>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are environmental protectors. Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the enviroment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers powers combine they summon Captain Planet, a superhero Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth, is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.

Captain Planet and the Planeteers is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: Inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose a defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out to the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. 

Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.</desc>

		<name>Captain Silver</name>
		<desc>In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.

There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN SILVER". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.

Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the "clock" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the "boot" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.</desc>

After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him. The only way Simon can break the count's curse is to find five of Dracula's body parts (which are mysteriously strewn throughout Transylvania) and burn them. 

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.</desc>

		<name>Challenger</name>
		<desc>One of Hudson Soft's earliest NES titles, Challenger is an arcade-style game that combines side scrolling, run 'n jump action with overhead, exploratory gameplay. The game consists of two parts.

The first level (or "scene") has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, Stop the Express.

Scene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different "keywords", which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.</desc>

The power, and the weight of the ball determine how much effect the control has. Up to four players can play using the NES Four Score accessory with all players taking turns to bowl.</desc>

		<name>Championship Pool</name>
		<desc>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. 

There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:

1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:

1. 14.1 Challenge – After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

4. Equal Offence – Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

5. Three Pool – Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.

6. Speed Pool – Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).

3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:

1. Eight Ball (2 Players)  – A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.

10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  – Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  –  Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.

		<desc>There were plans for a sequel to Cheetahmen I, but it was not completed (6 of 10 proposed levels were made) and was never officially released. In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading "Cheetamen II". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Dr. Morbis is out to destroy the Cheetahmen with all new traps and dangers. It is up to the Cheetahmen to make their way to Dr. Morbis' secret (and heavily guarded) laboratory to battle Dr. Morbis and his sub-humans (including the new, powerful ape-man). Cheetahmen II is a side scrolling platform game with arcade style action. There are three different Cheetahmen to control, a different one every second level.</desc>

Once upon a time there was the kingdom of Guldred, that had been reigned by Gulse I. All his glory brought peace and joy to people.One day, the assassination of Gulse I changed the land of peace into the battleground. That was plotted by General Guemon. It was the critical moment of the Guldred kingdom.
Under the circumstances, Gazem, an old knight advised Queen Liza and Princess Karen to ask Backviser for help. Backviser was King Gulse's old friend, who lived in the island of Chester Field. Liza and Karen decided to go there with Gazem.
On their way to the island, unfortunately, their ship was attacked by Guemon's men. Gazem fought bravely against the pirates in vain; he got badly wounded and Liza was killed, and what is worse, Princess Karen was imprisoned somewhere in the island of Chester Field.
The wounded knight drifted to the island, where he was treated by a young man named Kein. Gazem, however, breathed his last and after he told Kein all of his story.
Deeply moved by his story, Kein decided to go on a journey to reconstruct the Guldred kingdom. He had to rescue Princess Karen from the hand of the enemy and to fight against Guemon.
And then, the story of the young knight was beginning with the island of Chester Field....</desc>

		<name>Chip 'N Dale : Rescue Rangers 2</name>
		<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.</desc>

		<desc>Chitei Tairiku Ordola ("Underground Continent Ordola") is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game's model (in Ordola's case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it. In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk.

The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs. The bombs fly in a specific arc, so the player needs to be the right distance from the enemy in order to hit it. The player character can also crouch, jump, climb ladders and use other abilities common to platformers.</desc>

		<desc>Choplifter is a side-scrolling action/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper.  Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level.  Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you -- and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages!

Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles.  Many imitators and homages would follow.</desc>

		<name>Chuugoku Senseijutsu</name>
		<desc>A fortune-telling game that uses Eastern mysticism to prognosticate on the player's future, based on their year of birth. Though fortune-telling devices weren't unheard of, this was the first NES "game" to provide such a service. It would, however, be followed almost immediately with Induction Produce's '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai; another fortune-telling interactive simulator.

The player can choose to receive their fortune in distinct areas of their lives, including romantic prospects, the best time to marry their partner and the outcome of their future business dealings. Due to the minimal impact and relative obscurity of Eastern horoscopes in the west, the game was never released outside of Japan, though the US would eventually receive their own equivalent with Taboo: The Sixth Sense.</desc>

Players take control of the twin brothers (players can switch back and forth between each brother in the one player game) and explore the maze-like city, trying to locate and collect ten puppies. Several enemies roam the streets and the twins can throw punches or even baseballs at them in order to defend themselves. Defeating enemies increases the twins energy counter. Their energy also acts as a currency. They can and must spend their energy on certain items they find at shops. Only certain items can be used to beat the boss monsters who are holding the puppies captive. The twins will also need to locate certain shops to discard of items they no longer need as they each can only carry a handful of items at a time.</desc>

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again.  As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.</desc>

		<desc>Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective. The game combines role-playing game elements with an adventure game-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and "level up" after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.

The player character, Daisuke Kusano, is the son of an archaeologist who disappeared while searching for the Tears of Isis, artifacts once owned by Cleopatra. During the man's excavation for the Tears, demons appeared and abducted him. The boy soon learns that he must find the Tears in order to save his father. Over the course of the adventure, Daisuke visits the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Temple of Kom Ombo, a tower of sand, and an underground labyrinth.

		<name>Cliffhanger</name>
		<desc>Cliffhanger is based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from 2 cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</desc>

		<desc>Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat racing game that lets you do more than just race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre, but focuses more on manoeuvring than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low. But you should try not to hit too many walls. To get very far, you have to use your power-ups: TURBO for better acceleration, FIRE for more firepower, SPEED for faster speed, MISSILE to fire both missiles and bullets, and FORCE which lets you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You have about one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels, each with different objectives. The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels, 25 in total. The later levels are much more difficult than the first ones. They are peppered with extra obstacles like icebergs, more mines, ...</desc>

You start at the age of 14, becoming a apprentice aboard an old ship, where you learn the basics of combat. Your ultimate goal in this role-playing-game is to discover the continent America, just like the original model Christoph Kolumbus.
The Game can be played in two different modes. Either in "Normal Mode" or in "Historical Mode". The only difference of the historical mode compared to the normal mode, is that you have a limited ammount of time to complete the game. You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll want to keep your steps as low as possible.
Discover the new world and take your place in history!</desc>

		<name>Conflict</name>
		<desc>Conflict is a turn-based, hex-grid wargame for the NES that can be played by one or two players.  It is not a strictly historical wargame in which battles of the past are recreated using real-world geography.  Instead, the two opposing sides (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s. 

The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the "auto" mode which delegates command to the AI.
Splash graphics and text messages convey battle results.

By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains "fame" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.

Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Wars</name>
		<desc>Cosmic Wars takes you back to the Gradius universe as the 650-year long alliance between the Gradius empire and the Bacterions shatters and war breaks out again. The difference this time is that instead of fighting from the cockpit of your Vic-Viper starfighter you'll now be taking the commander's chair and take strategic control of your entire fleet.

The game is a turn-based strategy game in which you must first assemble your armada and then take them into outer space to defeat the enemy fleet. You view the action from a top-down galactic map and success in each phase rewards you with further cash which you can use to buy more ships. The game will continue until the enemy fleet is obliterated (or yours).

The game doesn't include a campaign, but instead provides you with a scenario designer from which you select the AI difficulty, which side you will take (you can play as either the Gradius empire or the Bacterions) the map you'll play and away you go. Features single or 2-player Vs gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Cosmo Police Galivan</name>
		<desc>Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity. As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.

The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.</desc>

There is also an RPG element to it where you have to visit people in the towns in order to proceed like at the very beginning where you need to first acquire a knife and you are then able to smash the chest and get money in order to buy a key which in turn allows you to enter the Sheriffs building. Once you are made sheriff you can go to various towns hunting down an outlaw for the bounty money.

		<name>Crackout</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

		<name>Crisis Force</name>
		<desc>The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl board their ships to fight off the threat.

This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.

The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.

When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.</desc>

He will meet up with the four wise people and learn their magic, while also obtaining the four elemental swords which will help him progress.</desc>

		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

		<name>Daisenryaku</name>
		<desc>One of many grand war simulations in Daisenryaku series, Daisenryaku for Famicom is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract "Blue" and "Red" countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other. Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.


 The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence values. This version uses "fake hexagons" for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.</desc>

		<name>Daiva - Imperial Of Nirsartia</name>
		<desc>DAIVA Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia is the sixth part of a seven part series developed by Toshiba EMI. The series is not a collection of sequential stories, but rather a presentation of the same story from seven different perspectives. Billed as an "Active Simulation War", each game has the player direct a different protagonist (or "hero") through a galactic war. In most versions, the player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the planet's defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the planet.
When designing the Famicom version of the game, Toshiba EMI took the system's capabilities, as well as it younger market audience, in to account. The game has been considerably simplified compared to its computer counterparts. Before starting an action sequence, the player is allowed to place three power-ups along a map of the stage. When the player reaches these designated locations, the specified power-up will fall from the sky for the player to collect. The game concludes when the player locates and conquers two specific planets; the Vuritora manufacturing planet, and Nirsartia.</desc>

		<path>./Dance Aerobics.7z</path>
		<name>Dance Aerobics</name>
		<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

		<desc>Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).

The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</desc>

		<name>Darkseed</name>
		<desc>This is a port of Dark Seed for DOS and Amiga, and the gameplay is essentially a slightly abridged version with several screens cut out. The player controls Mike Dawson, who (from the opening cutscene) has an alien growing in his head, causing him to have a massive headache. This happens after moving to a new house (which is later found to be a gateway to a parallel universe) and he has to go around figuring out what's going on. The storyline has been derived entirely from the original game, although it's slightly shorter in this version. The ending appears to be broken, as the librarian who talks to Mike at the end of the game repeats the same text infinitely.</desc>

		<name>Dash Galaxy In The Alien Asylum</name>
		<desc>You are Dash Galaxy, a fearless space explorer. You have just landed on a strange, alien planet thousands of light years from Earth. Your mission is to make your way though the maze of rooms and return safely to your ship. To do this you will need to enter every room and collect all of the objects that can be found in it. Your oxygen supply is limited, though, so be sure to hurry! Throughout this world there are many aliens which will deplete your oxygen even faster if you come into contact with them. Occasionally you will find bombs or keys which can be used to reach previously inaccessable rooms on a floor. The game is played from two points of view; top down when in an elevator shaft, or side scrolling when in one of the many rooms. Some levels contain hidden rooms with many bonuses, or even an express elevator to get you to your destination faster (or it might take you back down a few levels.)</desc>

Tenkaichi Budokai; translated as "Dragon Ball Z: A Fierce Battle at the Tenkaichi Budoukai") is the first fighting video game based on Dragon Ball Z. The game was unique in that it came with a special card reader attachment for the NES, the Datach Joint Rom System, which requires several special cards to be swiped in order to add characters and items in the game.
The game features many playable characters from the series (at least 28) and most of their transformations, with a corresponding trading card for each. There is also cards for varying versions of each single character, all with completely different attributes, statistics, and usable special moves. Each single version of a single character has only one special attack</desc>

		<desc>J. League Super Top Players has ten teams to choose from, and multiple game modes including an actual tournament or penalty kick practicing.

For the PK Battle modes, each player must select a different team. He must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is his turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that he will play as for the game(s).

The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).</desc>

Basically, this device reads barcodes from special cards that come with the game, with the character/item data being written onto these cards. This is the only way to play the game, since you must select a character or item by swiping its card. Aside from that interesting bit of innovation, SD Gundam Wars is a strategy/action game of sorts. The battles are automatic so you don't really control anything aside from scanning in your characters at the beginning, and scanning items at the start of each turn.</desc>

		<name>Days of Thunder</name>
		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

		<desc>In the space calendar 0385, the Earth suffers from overpopulation and humans started to build space colonies. Kirk, the protagonist of Dead Zone, works for the Earth federation's space development office. He is a brilliant engineer in space physics and he is working for Sirius third planet colony. He also got engaged with his beloved girlfriend Marry, but they had to postpone their wedding. Five months later, Kirk, accompanied with his robot Carry, decides to meet Marry at last, and prepare the ceremony. But when he arrives at the space station, everything is quiet. Then a beam of light hits him. He wakes up sometimes later, inside a sort of underground graveyard, pieces of dismantled robots surrounding him.

The player proceeds through the game by choosing from a selection of text menu commands. Like any traditional digital comic/text adventure games, a large view shows the surroundings. The bottom of the screen proposes simple action commands, like see, take or push; however, the game is entirely in Japanese (although it uses katakana exclusively). One of the original features of the game is to use real sampled sound in some places, which is very unusual for the time.</desc>

		<desc>Death Race is seemingly inspired by the Sylvester Stallone movie Death Race 2000 released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.

The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

		<desc>The Mutech Corporation has created their Gamma Base on what used to be Alcatraz Island. Their attempts at creating computer intelligence has backfired, as the AI they've created has taken over the computer systems and is threatening the world! Deep in the fortress is a gamma bomb, and your goal is to penetrate the fortress to destroy the bomb before it can be used. But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb! 

Gameplay is from an overhead point of view;  you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot. Good luck on your mission!</desc>

		<name>Madou Senki - Deep Dungeon</name>
		<desc>The town of Dorl has an infestation of demons who currently reside in the castles dungeon after a portal to the underworld was opened. The emperor of the underworld, Emperor Ruu, commanded his demons to raid the town to steal its treasure and during this ransacking the demons also managed to take Princess Etna's soul away too, leaving her in a comatose state. Many brave adventurers have entered the underground dungeon to try and reclaim her soul from this demon king, but none have returned successfully yet. So now it's up to the player to succeed where others have failed and put an end to the Emperor Ruu and also recover Princess Etna's soul.</desc>

		<name>Deep Dungeon 3 - Yuushi E No Tabi</name>
		<desc>Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi he no Tabi. Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.</desc>

		<name>Deep Dungeon 4 - Kuro No Yjutsushi</name>
		<desc>Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yjutsushi (lit. Deep Dungeon IV: The Black Sorcerer) is the fourth and final installment in the Deep Dungeon series. Unfortunately this game has removed the custom character feature of the previous game. Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept "requests" from the non-player characters. These are optional tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when finished.</desc>

The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave.

		<name>Defender of the Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.</desc>

A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).

		<desc>John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.

There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31 – 35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use a pistol or his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the submachine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flashbangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost.</desc>

		<name>Dig Dug</name>
		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<desc>It is Dig Dug's job to protect 72 different tropical islands from his arch rivals, Pooka and the fire breathing Fygar. Played from an overhead point of view, Dig Dug now has two weapons at his disposal; the first is an air pump and the second is a drill. The pump can be used to inflate and destroy the enemies the same as in the original Dig Dug. At various locations on the islands are stakes, and when the drill is used near a stake a crack will form. If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<name>Dirty Harry</name>
		<desc>Dirty Harry is based on the popular Clint Eastwood movie character of "Dirty" Harry Callahan (rather than the specific movie "Dirty Harry"), a cop famous for his use of a .44 magnum for doing away with evildoers, and for his catchphrase, "Go ahead, make my day." In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.

This is not a one-way side-scroller, however. There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.</desc>

		<name>Dokuganryuu Masamune</name>
		<desc>Dokuganryu Masamune is a historical simulation game developed and produced by Namco for the Famicom in 1988. It is the third such game to appear on the Famicom inside of a month, including Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition and HOT-B's Takeda Shingen. This game is based on the life of Date Masamune, who held power in Japan during the early Edo period. An outstanding tactician, he was made all the more iconinc for his missing eye, and Date was often called dokuganryu.

In the game, you play as the warring overlord, and your aim is the unification of 11 regions under one rule. While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents. The difficulty of the game can be set, there are eight commands, and four types of battle forces. This game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from the original Japanese.</desc>

Once you do, you can pick them up and throw them at other enemies, and collect the fruit that they leave behind. When you have defeated all enemies, you proceed onwards to the next round. If you take too long to complete a level, a winged devil will appear who will try to kill you while flying around the screen

Occasionally, power-ups will appear in the middle of the level, and these power-ups will increase your power, award you with different weapons, kill enemies, or freeze time. The more power you have,  the more walls that you can through enemies through. At maximum power, you are able to throw enemies through all walls.
If you happen to carry the blue hammer, you are able to throw it through walls, too.

There are five areas that consist of ten levels each. At the end of each area, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed further.</desc>

To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons. 

You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong has lodged in a greenhouse and it's bugging the bees out of Stanley! Based on the third game in the enormously popular arcade series, Donkey Kong 3 introduces an exterminator named Stanley as he desperately tries to protect the flowers in his greenhouse from Donkey Kong. Armed only with a can of bug spray, Stanley must force Donkey Kong higher and higher into the greenhouse rafters until Donkey Kong is off the screen and the next stage is reached. But not surprisingly, Donkey Kong isn't going to move without a fight, so he sends wave after wave of bugs, bees, and other creatures toward Stanley. Not only must Stanley repel the insects in order to save the flowers, but he'll have to keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by Donkey Kong himself. If Stanley is good enough, he'll be able to grab a can of more powerful bug spray and really get Donkey Kong moving. It all adds up to frantic fun that anyone can enjoy!</desc>

		<desc>Mario as a villain, who would have thought it? But this is the unlikely scenario of Donkey Kong Jr. on NES. Yes, the mustachioed villain has locked Donkey Kong in a cage and it's up to his offspring to get him out of the clutches of this devious plumber. Our friendly primate will have to climb along lianas to reach the top of the board, while avoiding the various objects that Mario sees fit to throw at his face.</desc>

Some time ago, Giga Zombie revived dead kings in order to conquer the world. Doraemon and his friends fought the evil being, but were trapped in a magical portal, and ended up in different time periods.

The inclusion of a large keyboard with the game makes Doremikko the most expensive Famicom Disk System title at the time of its original sale.The title of the game is often mistranslated as "Dreamiko", but it is intended to be a play on the names for the first three notes of a scale; Do, Re, Mi. Having been developed by Konami, the game actually features a medly of Gradius music, and contains a cameo of the Vic Viper on the menu screen.

"Double Dragon II" ix essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, it discards the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. 
Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.</desc>

A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on the popular Japanese manga series "Dragon Ball" - more precisely, its Saiyajin Saga part. It follows the events that occur after the evil Radditz tells Son Goku, the series' main hero, about his true origin as a Saiyajin, and suggests uniting their powers. As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan. Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the leader of Saiyajin...

In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.</desc>

		<desc>The second in the Dragon Ball Z RPG series, "Freezer the Planet Destroyer", as it is often unofficially translated, follows closely the popular manga series and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG,  Assault of Saiyajins. After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls that would bring Piccolo back to life. The trouble is, Vegeta is heading to the planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...

You control both Son Gohan's and Son Goku's parties, including popular characters like Krillin, Yamcha, and others. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the first game. Locations are composed of squares, and you move through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on cards - your choice determines the strength of the move and the outcome of the automatic battle.</desc>

Following the events depicted in the manga series those games are based on, "Hot Battle" picks up the story right where it ended in the previous game: in the ultimate battle, Son Goku defeated Freezer, the evil Planet Destroyer. However, Freezer's brother Cooler swears revenge. Son Goku and his friends have once again to fight the evil in order to keep the miraculous Dragon Balls.

In this game, you control many characters from the animé series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team. In battles, you have three active characters, but you can switch and train them in between. The RPG system is similar to the one used in the first two games: your movements on the field and during battles are determined by the type of cards you choose from several available ones. The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.</desc>

		<desc>In Dragon Fighter the protagonist is a fighter who can turn into a dragon. In this side-scrolling action game the hero can walk, jump, and slash with his sword. He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

The game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

		<desc>Aeons ago, two dragons and their follower were fighting each other. The  "Black Mages" worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and the "White Mages" worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. The wars fought for territory and ideals where endless. After ages of fighting, the god Narume put the Chrome Dragon to sleep in the mountains and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert, to stop the wars. Then he took th magic away from the mages, and sealed it in the 8 Magic Books, which he hid in the sacred desert tower.

Hundreds of years later, three thieves stumbled upon the desert tower, and found the Magic Books. They split them up amongst themselves and every one of them, walked his own way. Now that the Magic Books were gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke from his slumber.  Narume then infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of justice, summoning him forth in the form of a hero named "Feram"
Now it is up to him, to find the Magic Books and put the Chrome Dragon to sleep again.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

Unlike the first game, Dragon Warrior II allows the player to join forces with two other characters, a magic-using princess and a wizard-warrior prince. Also including expanded monster battles involving up to 6 creatures and a much larger world, Dragon Warrior II is an important step in the evolution of the Dragon Warrior series.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Warrior 4, the fourth volume in the Dragon Warrior series (and the last on the NES), once again took the elements of the previous games and expanded them into a five chapter saga of epic proportions.
  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Wars</name>
		<desc>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

		<desc>The player assumes the role of Bruce Lee, who uses Liu Kang's sprites. The levels are split into a platforming/action section and a one-on-one fighting section, with both sections using the same control mechanics. The end level boss is another character from Mortal Kombat 1 but is renamed in a ridiculous fashion. The bosses are made up of Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Kano, &amp; Raiden. Cinema scenes before and after each level loosely refer to some of Bruce Lee's films.

Besides the main story mode there is also a "battle" option, which allows you to select and fight any of the five level bosses in a best 2-out-of-3 match. There is no option for a 2nd human player to join, nor can you play as any of the other characters.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Lair</name>
		<desc>The NES version for Dragon's Lair brings Dirk the Daring in a side-scrolling game, different from the interactive movie gameplay common to the other games under the same license.

Once again, Dirk is up to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe. To do so, Dirk will use weapons such knifes, axes, fire balls, etc, thrown against dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), among other foes. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.

At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.

Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the most of the threats. He also has a "candle bar", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.

The game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The PAL version has faster gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and splash screens in between the levels.</desc>

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. The player has to shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety - this is the Dropzone.</desc>

		<name>Duck Hunt</name>
		<desc>Duck Hunt is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It requires the use of the Zapper light gun. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares ducks (one or two at a time) out of the swamp, and they go flying around in the air. The player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed.

Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.</desc>

In this puzzle game, you control one of the dudes as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that your dude has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, you have to bounce across a paint can (an attitude converter) that will change your dude to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time. This is an unlicensed game.</desc>

		<desc>All weekend ballplayers know softball's no joke, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!

Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.

There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night

In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.

With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</desc>

Mad robosaurs have overrun the planets of this man-made solar system and it is up to Professor Proteus to take the controls of the #1 robosaur, the Cyborasaurus. The goal is to get to the center of all 7 planets in this solar system and disable the artificially intelligent life support systems, which are guarded by progressively tougher defense.

Gameplay consists of getting into your robosaur, tromping across the surface of desolate planets in the solar system, fighting meaner robosaurs, and equipping better weapons along the way (you can launch your dino's fist!). Once you make it to the middle of each planet, you eject from the Cyborasaurus and head to the life support computer. Destroy the computer and get out fast.</desc>

Many rooms have more than one exit for Lolo to choose from, and a map can be collected along the way to provide the player with information about where he or she is, and what rooms have already been visited. Secret entrances to hidden chambers must be found so that keys can be collected, enabling the player to explore deeper into the castle.</desc>

		<name>Eggerland - Souzou Heno Tabidachi</name>
		<desc>Souzou he no Tabidachi translates to "Departure to Creation." Like with "Revival of the Labyrinth" before, this is a fitting description of the game itself. It references the fact that it brings the Creation Mode from the original back to the series, after it was abandoned in the previous two installments. It further resembles the first title in that it's also one of the most basic entries in the franchise, and among the easiest of the Japanese releases. It's also tied for the shortest game in the entire series, with just fifty puzzles in all. Given that the predecessors all had a hundred or more, this might seems like a problem, but the caliber of the puzzles is as high as ever. So if you found the prequels to be a bit overwhelming, then this might be the best of the early titles to start with. Interestingly, this seems to have been one of the FDS titles that were available solely from Disk Writer machines, as it doesn't appear to have ever been released at retail.</desc>

Use a pistol, kicks, an elevator, and even the lights to take out the building's guards. The gun-fighting action is full of thrills! You will need speed and timing to get on the elevators, move between floors, steal the secret papers, and escape from the basement parking lot.</desc>

		<path>./Eliminator Boat Duel.7z</path>
		<name>Eliminator Boat Duel</name>
		<desc>Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.

A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.</desc>

		<name>Elysion</name>
		<desc>Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.

The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.

"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.</desc>

		<name>Emi-chan No Moero Yakyuuken!</name>
		<desc>It's a strip janken game. Janken's just a fancy Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors I think, but janken's easier to type. The whole ?strip? part of the game is, for every match you lose, you take off an article of clothing. Woo! For every match you win, Emi (the girl you play against) takes off an article of clothing. WOO! For every match you tie, Emi puts back on an article of clothing. WHAT?! Yeah, it's a pirate game, no one said it had to be fair.

What's even more unfair is, once you get Emi down to like, four articles of clothing, you have to win three times against various barnyard animals. Win three times against a barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. Win three MORE times against another barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. So yeah, the match is pretty easily stacked in her favor, wouldn't you say? Too bad you don't have any mammals lying around to protect YOU in your strip janken game.

So yeah, just use up and down to cycle through the different hands, and hit A to choose what you want. Yeah, really complicated.</desc>

		<name>Emoyan No 10 Bai Pro Yakyuu</name>
		<desc>Emoyan no 10-bai Pro Yakyuu ("Emoyan's Tenfold Pro Baseball") is a baseball sim for the NES produced by Hect. It features the name and likeness of former pitcher Takenori "Emoyan" Emoto, who by 1989 had already retired from baseball but continued to work as a commentator and author of books on the sport, before eventually going into politics in the '90s. One such book, titled "How To Make Watching Pro Baseball Ten Times More Fun," is where this game derives its name. Besides Emoyan, the game uses fictional players and team names.

The game has a heavier sim aspect than most baseball sims for the Famicom, with players choosing a spot on a grid to both bat and pitch towards, the idea being to predict the ball's movement or the batter's likelihood of reaching it. Fielding is performed automatically.</desc>

		<name>Erika To Satoru No Yume Bken</name>
		<desc>Two children, the girl Erika and the boy Satoru, live together in a small house somewhere in modern Japan. One day, before going to sleep, they notice a strange creature outside: it looks like a pink-white cat (Final Fantasy fans would immediately say: a moogle!), but talks like a human being. Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: "Children! Find the Time Crown!". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!

"Erika &amp; Satoru" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.</desc>

		<desc>Far beyond our world, there's a world that resides in the books you read. But the five areas of the Book Worlds are in deep trouble! As Mamoru, a bookworm with ESP, you must go forth (with the help of a magical fairy and several other allies) to grab five special rings and save the Book Worlds from many perils.

This sequel to Esper Dream takes you as Mamoru on a mystical journey through 4 areas (one of them, the world of the original "Esper Dream", has already been done for you), each with their own problems that you need to fix. Like its predecessor, you begin battles (which now take place in different battlefields) by running into pairs of moving footprints - however this time Mamoru can simply run away from battles that are too much for him, or use a Teleport spell in enclosed fields. (Using this spell outside of battle will return you to the base town for that world.) In addition, Mamoru can bring along a friend (one per world and controlled by the CPU) who can assist him while battling and give him clues about where to go next. Mamoru can also carry healing items with him, for a quick boost of energy when he's running low.

The game ends when Mamoru's HP reaches 0 - or when you have saved the Book Worlds.</desc>

It was the first of Konami's "Exciting Sports" series produced for the Nintendo Famicom, similar to Namco's own "Family Sports" label. Exciting Billiard offers players four modes of play. Break Shot is a single player only mode, where the player competes against other pool hustlers for money, attempting to earn enough money to graduate to higher and more impressive venues with increasing amounts of money on each bet. The remaining three modes can be played with one to four players at a time (human or computer controlled), with each players' progress capable of being saved to disk.</desc>

		<name>Exciting Boxing</name>
		<desc>Exciting Boxing is a very unusual game in that it was sold packaged with a special controller. This controller was actually a plastic inflatable stand with the image of a boxer depicted in the front, and several sensors located on the inside. To play the game, players must inflate the stand, and literally punch the boxer on the front. The sensors inside would register the hits and transfer the information to the game, where the results of the player's punches would be shown on the screen.</desc>

		<name>Chou Fuyuu Yousai Exed Exes</name>
		<desc>On a planet 6000 light-years from earth, there were creatures called Exes, which resemble large insects, that were used for industrial purposes. However, these creatures one day took to revolting against their creators. Two battle machines have been sent to fight against the Exes, known as Colonel and Sargent. The Exes are nearing completion of their secret weapon, Exed Exes, and they must be defeated before this is allowed to happen!

Exed Exes is a basic vertical scrolling shooter, converted from the 1985 coin-op. The game scrolls forward, and the player can maneuver their ship around the screen to shoot enemies and avoid attack. POW icons sometimes appear that can power up the ship or turn enemies into fruit that are worth extra points. The game can be played either solo or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens.

		<name>Famicom Grand Prix 2 3d Hot Rally</name>
		<desc>The second game in the Famicom Grand Prix series. In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.



In order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.



As the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.</desc>

		<desc>Famicom Jump II: Saiky no Shichinin (Famikon Janpu Ts Saiky no Shichinin, lit. "Famicom Jump II: The Strongest Seven") is a 1991 RPG for the Family Computer published by Bandai. The sequel to Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden, the game features seven main characters (as the subtitle indicates) from different Weekly Sh?nen Jump manga serialized at the time. Only four of the 16 represented titles from the original are brought back, while the remaining three are new to the sequel. There would not be another crossover game until the release of Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars (of which six of these series would be represented, the only one not being Magical Tarurto-kun).
The player may begin the game with any of these seven characters. The player character chosen reflects the path the player will take through the characters' universes- starting from the selected character's home universe.

The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...</desc>

		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima is a Famicom Disk System text adventure game. The plot revolves around an elderly couple with no children who adopt an infant boy and girl. When the children turn six, a dragon appears in the country, and starts turning people into Oni who steal the souls of others. The Oni arrive at their home and steal the elderly couple's souls. The children decide to save their adoptive parents.

The game is controlled by selecting commands such as the "Change Character" command, which allows you to switch between controlling Donbe (the boy) and Hikari (the girl). The game progress is shown by changes in the in-game graphics. The Famicom Disk System version comes on two disks released on different dates. Disk 2 cannot be played without completing Disk 1, and is switched while the system is still powered on. All later releases are switch-free.</desc>

		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuuyuuki ("Famicom Fairy Tales: Yuuyuuki") is the second of two text adventure games in the Famicom Mukashibanashi series developed by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves for the Famicom Disk System peripheral. It shares many similarities with its predecessor Shin Onigashima: Both games required two disks that were released separately, both feature an innovative "main character switch" feature that allows the player to switch from two playable characters and both are based on ancient Far Eastern literature. In Yuuyuuki's case the literature in question is the ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West.

The player controls Goku (Sun Wukong) and Chao (an original character) who are travelling separate journeys to meet up with each other. True to the novel, Goku is also accompanying the monk Sanzo (Tripitaka) and his other followers Hakkai (Pigsy) and Gojo (Sandy), though these three characters have been comedically reimagined as lazy and greedy.

As with Shin Onigashima and many adventure games for the system the player directs the player character via a menu of commands. They can talk, examine, pick up and otherwise interact with all sorts of people and items in the surroundings. An ability to switch between Goku and Chao is frequently available as well.</desc>

		<desc>Another variation on the theme of shogi - the Japanese analogue of chess with a LOT of squares, pieces and possibilities. The player is invited to take part in the Dragon King tournament (and if he loses, he will not even be thrown away, but will be offered a place in the audience), and those who are not yet able to do this can get their hands on single games or traditional problems like "checkmate in three moves." Unlike Famicom Meijin Sen, here the invisible hand with a piece moves freely around the entire field and in case of a wrong move returns it to its place. Otherwise, as in other similar simulators, the main factor of playability is NOT knowledge of the Japanese language, but sufficient knowledge of the rules of the original game.</desc>

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

		<desc>The Red Star nation and the Blue Moon nation are at war. Each has deployed troops and works to obtain enough funds so as to buy the necessary military hardware to overcome the other side.

Famicom Wars is a turn-based strategy game. The player takes the role of commander of military forces for either the Red Star or Blue Moon armies. The goal of each battle map is to overcome the other side's forces, destroying all enemy units and capturing all enemy-held landmarks. Each side of the battle takes their turn, moving units across the map. The capture of cities will give that side extra funds which can be used to build new units at factories and shipyards.

Famicom Wars features 17 maps total to battle across.</desc>

The game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of only having a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.</desc>

The fourth of Namco's lengthy "Family" series of sports games and the first to concentrate on tennis, Family Tennis plays much like its Nintendo forebear and other tennis game contemporaries. It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win.

Family Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however. There was also four female characters, of the sixteen total, who all had a bigger racket then the men. Essentially making the women into an 'Easy Mode'</desc>

		<path>./Family Trainer 3 - Aerobics Studio.7z</path>
		<name>Dance Aerobics</name>
		<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

		<name>Super Team Games</name>
		<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

		<desc>Famista '89: Kaimaku Ban!! (roughly "Opening Game Edition") is a baseball sim from Namco, and marks the first occasion where the Family Stadium game series would officially shorten its name to "Famista" rather than the longer "Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium" brand it had carried previously.

As with all previous Family Stadium sequels, Famista maintains the series' trademark "chibi" look and baseball mechanics while updating the rosters for the current year (in this case, 1989).</desc>

		<name>Faria : A World of Mystery &amp; Danger!</name>
		<desc>It was a stormy night. Cold wind raged, and rain poured over the country. The wise men understood at once: the prophecy has become reality. The spell of the Legendary Sword was lifted...

Fast-forward to three months later. You are a nameless young adventurer, looking for some action. Your first task is... you guessed it, to rescue a princess. After the king gives you this assignment, you are free to roam about the world, visiting dangerous caves and towers, and fulfilling ancient prophecies..

"Faria" is a combination of console-style RPG exploration and character development (like in  Final Fantasy or  Dragon Quest) with real-time battles. On the world map, you are randomly attacked by enemies, and have to eliminate them running around the battle field and attacking them physically or casting spells. In the complex, maze-like towers the enemies appear everywhere. There is also a good deal of puzzles to solve in the dungeons.</desc>

Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.
There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score. You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items. Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell.</desc>

		<path>./Felix the Cat.7z</path>
		<name>Felix the Cat</name>
		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

		<name>Felix the Cat</name>
		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

		<name>Fester's Quest</name>
		<desc>Uncle Fester was out one night, moonbathing in the yard of the Addams Family property one day when suddenly, out of the sky, a UFO descended and started beaming alien creatures to the planet. Grabbing his gun, Fester sets off to stop the aliens and slay their boss creatures, encountering other Addams Family members along the way who will aid him.

Fester's Quest is an overhead-view game in which Uncle Fester uses his gun, or later, a whip to attack enemies near him. Enemies drop money and power-ups. The money can be used at Hot Dog stands to replenish health. A variety of items can be collected, each with a different effect. Fester and the rest of the Addams family are based on their characters from the popular 1960s TV show (this game was made before the remakes in  both series and movie form).</desc>

		<name>Fighting Hero</name>
		<desc>Fighting Hero is an unlicensed fighting game created by NTDEC in 1991, based off Street Fighter. The controls are similar to the original Street Fighter in that A punches and B kicks. However, the controls are often criticized because attacks initiate once the player lets go of the button. You're also unable to walk while holding a button. If you let go of the button too quick, Leon will only move for about a frame and the attack won't come out. Jump attacks preform a bit differently: you must hold the button and then jump. Leon will preform the attack a certain point in the air. For whatever reason, you're unable to preform special moves unless you have a cheat code.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a fairly typical one-on-one fighting game. It appears to use a similar engine to Rex Soft's fighting games, with slow walking, quick jumping, and generally choppy animation. The A button punches and the B button kicks, with both having different animations if the player holds Back or Forward while attacking. It is possible to throw by pressing Back and A while close, and blocking is performed by holding Back.
The cast consists of 10 original characters. Each character has two duplicates with different names and colors. In single-player, the player always uses the original, and the computer always uses the first duplicate.
Much like the first Fighting Hero, the game has a high difficulty level that cannot be changed, although the player is given nine continues.</desc>

The game plays from a non-scrolling side view and plays like most one-on-one fighters: you move around the screen avoiding your opponent's attacks and then unleash your own with combinations of your attack buttons and directional arrows. Additionally the game features special moves in the form of specific combinations of directional moves that trigger unique attacks. These moves however deplete your stamina bar which can leave you defenseless against enemy attacks.</desc>

Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out.</desc>

		<name>Fire 'n Ice</name>
		<desc>The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters. Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game where the goal is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. You can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally in the direction faced, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so you have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. So it's possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless on icy surface).</desc>

		<desc>Fire Rock is an action game developed for the Famicom Disk System by System Sacom, and published in Japan by Use in 1988. The design of the game is credited to Mark Flint. In the game, the player controls what appears to be a cave man, whose goal is to navigate a series of item filled caverns in an effort to locate the boss of the level, defeat it, and then locate the door which leads to the next level. The game is commonly sited as having very poor controls, often requiring the player to grab hold of a wall, and very slowly climb it by holding up and tapping jump repeatedly. Other issues include a very low jump that places more platforms and items out of reach, and a difficult time bringing the character back under control if he starts to slip. This game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<desc>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.

While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.</desc>

According to the story mentioned in the manual, Kenshirou, the main character, has to save the people from the evil Emperor Heaven. The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Fleet Commander</name>
		<desc>Fleet Commander is a strategy game developed and published by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.

A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the "Turbo File," which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.</desc>

		<desc>The Flintstones and the Rubbles were enjoying a fine day when suddenly, someone from the future called Dr. Butler arrived and stole their pets, Dino and Hoppy!  Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!

The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.  Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack.  Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.

After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.  There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.</desc>

The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is the second Flintstones-licensed game for the NES. There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.</desc>

		<name>Fengshenbang</name>
		<desc>During the final days of Shang-Yin dynasty in China (11th century BC), general Li Jing had a son named Ne Zha. The boy had extraordinary talents for martial arts, and for that reason the god Tai Yi gave him three powerful artifacts. One day he went to swim in the sea and disturbed the prince of dragons. The prince became angry and went out of the water to fight Ne Zha. Unaware of the power of the artifacts, Ne Zha unintentionally killed the prince. The Dragon Lord could not China if Ne Zha stays alive. Ne Zha killed himself to protect his land, and Tai Yi, touched by his sacrifice, revived him and made him more powerful than ever before. Now Ne Zha is strong enough to find three other legendary warriors and to defeat the evil king Zhou, the last one of Shang-Yin dynasty, and to put a just ruler on the throne instead.

Fengshenbang is a traditional Asian-style RPG. Most of the game is spent fighting random enemies and gain experience points to level up. The turn-based combat is viewed mostly from first-person perspective, although you can see your characters on the screen when they are attacking. The simple battle system allows you to use physical attacks or cast magic. The interface of the game requires you to select actions from a menu, in  Dragon Quest style.</desc>

To get to Jason, you must run around a camp, killing zombie ghouls and collecting weapons, until you hear an alarm sound.  When that alarm goes off, it means Jason has entered a cabin and you must find him.

To save time, you can switch between all six counselors, depending on where you are.  Once you enter the house that Jason is in, the game switches to a 3D-esque maze in which you have to hurt Jason with the items you collected.  Once he's been damaged enough, he'll run away, only to sound another alarm later and enter another house.</desc>

		<path>./Fun House.7z</path>
		<name>Fun House</name>
		<desc>Fun House is based on a children's television game show of the same name.

The basic premise of the game is to get through the 72 rooms of the Fun House. The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. 

This may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.

The player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.

Other helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.</desc>

Each level is in three main parts:  The fight into the mission zone, the mission zone, and the escape from the mission zone.  The stages where you fight into and escape from the mission zone are straightforward action – just fight your way to the end of the stage, and defeat the stage boss.

The actual mission zone is a maze, where the object is to place bombs at pre-determined locations, then find and use the exit.  The mazes start out easy with the first one being only two screens high and 4 long.  Level 6 is 7 by 8 for a total of 56 screens.

Characters:

Duke (Tiger Force first sergeant/squad leader), Rock &amp; Roll (gatling gunner), Capt. Grid-Iron (hand-to-hand combat specialist), Blizzard (arctic attack soldier), Snake Eyes (commando)</desc>

		<desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<name>Galaxy 5000 : Racing in the 51st Century</name>
		<desc>Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).

A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player ("Hey!", "Excuse me!", "Watch it!"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.</desc>

		<name>Gall Force - Eternal Story</name>
		<desc>Based upon the anime of the same name, Gall Force is a group of science fiction anime OAV series by the studio Artmic, with production by Youmex and AIC. The original character designs were by Kenichi Sonoda. In the original story line, an all-out, prehistoric galactic war rages between the all-female Solnoids and the amorphous Paranoids for too long. In the midst of battle, a plan which was secretly hatched by the leaders of both sides comes into fruition, and an unsuspecting crew of seven Solnoid soldiers aboard the Kulanis-class Cruiser named the Star Leaf is caught up in the middle.

The Famicom Disk System game is a top down shooter and follows a different story than that of the OAVs. It features Rabby flying across Terra, and catapulting into six different regions of space in order to rescue each of her crew members one at a time. With each crew member that you rescue, you gain access to a new configuration for your ship.</desc>

Beyond the manga license, it is very much still a mahjong game, focusing mostly on playing the tile-based board game, though using a difficult variation on the usual rules of the game. Gambler Jiko Chuushinha was notable for having several developers working on the project including Bits Laboratory, Yellow Horn and Game Arts.

Joining Goemon in his adventure is the wacky ninja Ebisumaru which allows for simultaneous 2-player gameplay, marking the biggest difference in terms of gameplay with the original. The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.</desc>

One day Goemon returns home and finds out his favorite smoking pipe is gone. Who could have done such a horrible crime? Goemon's friend Ebisumaru offers to help him to find out the criminal, and both embark on a journey full of adventures and danger.

Like most console-style RPGs of the time, "Goemon Gaiden" utilizes a simple turn-based battle system. You talk to town people to gather information, buy weapons, armor and items, fight random enemies, descend into dungeons and find treasures.</desc>

But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...

The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).</desc>

		<name>Ganso Saiyuuki - Super Monkey Daibouken</name>
		<desc>This game is based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The goal of the game is to survive the long and arduous journey from China to India.

Players take control of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, as he helps guide Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk, on his quest to collect some Buddhist sutras. Xuanzang also rides a horse who is actually a dragon prince. Along the way, players will also join up with other guardians to add to their party.

In the game, players go on a journey across an overworld map. Players have to find certain locations or buildings in order to move along in their adventure. Some buildings will lead the player into a short side-scrolling action stage where the player has to defeat an onslaught of enemies. Also, players have to be on a lookout for spots where they can pick up food and drink so they don't starve or die of thirst on their lengthy journey.

Since the game lacks a proper save feature, the player will occasionally be given a code input to put in at the game's title screen, so the player can continue the game from where the code input was given.</desc>

Their owner, Jon, is too lazy to go look for Odie himself, so he has Garfield go out and look for him. And so Garfield heads off, out into the world.

A Week of Garfield is a side-scrolling platform game based on the comic strip by Jim Davis. Garfield heads to the right through various indoor and outdoor city environments, dealing with endless vermin like frogs, birds, and mice using his judo kick skills and several different weapons such as bones that can be thrown. He has a life bar that can quickly deplete if he isn't careful, but hidden all around each stage are various items, which can replenish his health, refill his weapon supplies, and give him super speed or invincibility; be careful, though, as sometimes he'll also find fish bones which will harm Garfield if eaten.

The game is divided into seven stages, each representing a day of the week, and each with several sections. At the end of each section is a door, and Garfield must find the key hidden somewhere on the screen to unlock the door and continue. At the last door of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated before Garfield can find the key. Each stage also has a strict time limit to keep him from dawdling, and between stages, Jon will appear to encourage Garfield or give him some advice.</desc>

		<name>Garou Densetsu Special</name>
		<desc>Garou Densetsu Special (literally "Hungry Wolf Legend") is a pirated port of Fatal Fury Special by Hummer Team, made for the Famicom in 1995. This is a port of the SNES version.
This version includes 8 characters and four repeats of each: Kim Kaphwan, Tung Fu Rue, Wolfgang Krauser, Ryo Sakazaki, Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi and Mai Shiranui. All of the characters are playable. Like some Hummer Team fighting games, the difficulty can be changed on the title screen. Unlike the original game, the characters don't get their own stages, instead they go in a preset loop throughout the game. As well as this, some of the characters' original stages aren't present in this game.
The graphics are taken from the original game and downgraded. The music is mostly taken from there as well, but one song is remixed from Street Fighter IV, and the ending music from Kart Fighter is present here. The ending is a shortened version of the one from the original game.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

		<name>Gegege No Kitarou 2 - Youkai Gundan No Chousen</name>
		<desc>Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. 

Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. 

The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.</desc>

		<name>Geimos</name>
		<desc>Geimos is an arcade style space shooter where players take control of a spaceship that flies over several different planets' surfaces destroying the incoming enemy units. 

The game contains two different game modes. "Mode A" keeps the games camera perspective in the same position. Players have control over their spaceships altitude while flying around the screen and can fire two different weapons. One weapon is meant for ground enemies while the other weapon is meant for aerial enemies. While the majority of the enemies are gun towers, ships and tanks that can be defeated in one shot, at the end of each round players will have to face off with a gigantic boss enemy that will require several shots to defeat.

Mode B is similar to Mode A, but now the camera follows the players ship's movements instead. This mode also features a fixed target reticle in front of the player's ship to help with aiming their fire.</desc>

Kagekiyo travels the country searching for his eternal nemeses all the while fighting youkai and other monsters. These fights are depicted as one-on-one turn-based struggles where the player and creature's health is depicted as candles. Kagekiyo can regenerate health at shrines by spending money and can also level up stats at torii gates by spending "toku", or virtue. Both money and toku are earned defeating enemies.

The game has a physical board game component as well. Included in the box is several miniatures and a fold-out board. Players use the board to move their pieces, but all combat is depicted in-game.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

While taking a shortcut through the graveyard home one day, he comes across a glowing skull. Intrigued, he takes it to Dr. Femur, his anatomy teacher, the next day, which happens to be the day before Halloween. Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.

During the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.

Spike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.

Spike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.

Get going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.</desc>

		<name>Ginga Denshou - Galaxy Odyssey</name>
		<desc>Ginga Denshou - Galaxy Odyssey is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System by Wave Jack, and published by Imagineer in 1986. Unlike most games for the FDS, Galaxy Odyssey did not come with just a disk and an instruction booklet. Among the contents found in the large box, were an audio cassette tape and a book recounting the game's story.The game itself is quite unusual as well. It features a blend of vertical shooting gameplay mixed with more Zelda-like exploration sequences. As the pilot of a ship, you could dock with certain dungeon entrances, and take a shuttle down to the ground to explore and search for items. Searching around isn't easy at first, since you run out of oxygen fairly quickly, and that starts to drain your life, of which you start out with three bars.To win the game, you must find the medicine needed to rescue the people who are suffering from a disease in your home area. To do so, you must collect warp codes, and translate alien codes, and blast off from one dungeon location to travel to another. The game's text is in Japanese, and has never been translated to another language.</desc>

		<name>Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (usually translated as "Legend of the Galactic Heroes") is a sci-fi themed strategy game in which the player controls a fleet of starships. It is based on the long-running space opera novel series of the same name which has been adapted into various other media such as manga and anime. This early NES version is simply one of many video game incarnations of this franchise, all of which shame the same name. The goal of the game is to direct the various commanders of the player character's fleet by giving them specific orders. Eventually, the player will be required to direct massive battles between their fleet and the rival empire's. A NES midi variant of the classical music piece Bolero by Ravel plays throughout, lending the game a suitably operatic feel.</desc>

		<desc>Official port of "The Earth Fighter Rayiezax" originally published on NEC PC-8801.
In the year 2300, the human race created an Earth federation government and spread out into space to begin colonizing the surrounding planets. However, an alien species from the far reaches of outer space began attacking the human forces, putting the very survival of the human race at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the enormous power of the enemy forces, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars. The journey begins as he makes his way back to Earth along with the other members of his unit.</desc>

		<desc>In a completely different style from the first Nintendo Godzilla game from Toho, you play as japanese military forces fighting against Godzilla. Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.
Beware Godzilla!</desc>

		<desc>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.</desc>

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.</desc>

		<name>Golf '92, The</name>
		<desc>The Golf '92 is a Family Computer video game that involves golfing with popular Japanese golf pros.
There are three difficulty levels and the game is almost completely in Japanese. There are also three modes: leaderboard (similar to major PGA events), tournament (using a format found in most sports playoffs), and stroke play. Players have a crowd to play their round of golf into front of.
In the hardest difficulty levels, players are confronted with wind levels approaching that of a hurricane while the wind is almost stagnant in the easiest difficulty level.[3] One of the drawbacks of the game is that the player must determine the angle of their flight separately from the strength of their swing and the type of golf club that they will use.</desc>

		<name>Golf Grand Slam</name>
		<desc>This game was made with the intentions of helping the player improve their golf game. You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.

The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</desc>

		<desc>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball.

		<name>The Goonies II</name>
		<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movie’s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn’t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

A group of youngsters from a neighborhood called the "Goon Docks" are trying to find the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willie to prevent the foreclosure of their houses. Unfortunately, the treasure is buried under the hide-out of the infamous Fratelli gang, a family of ruthless criminals who are on the run from the law. You play as the asthmatic Mikey, who must find the treasure and save the other Goonies before time runs out.

The game consists of six levels. In each level, you must collect three keys to advance to the next area. These can be found by blowing open doors with bombs that are dropped by enemies. Also hidden behind doors are power-ups and other Goonies to rescue. Trying to stop you are enemies such as rats, skeletons, and even members of the Fratelli Gang. 

Unlike the sequel, the Famicom version was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Gotcha! : The Sport!</name>
		<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.

One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.

The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.</desc>

		<name>Gradius 2</name>
		<desc>Gradius II is a sequel to Gradius, and Life Force, and is a horizontal space shooter composed of 7 levels.
Like it's predecessor, you can collect power up from enemies and chose which ones to use when. This time, this system is enhanced because you can chose between 4 different power-up sequences, allowing you to use differents types of weapons against your enemies. There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows your spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While you only could have 2 of them in Gradius, you now can have up to 4 of them.</desc>

		<path>./Grand Master.7z</path>
		<name>Grand Master</name>
		<desc>Grand Master is an action RPG, featuring a cool intro, neat music, and most importantly: a hero with a sword so high you can't get over it, so low you can't get under it, and so wide you can't get around it.
The game itself plays from a top-down perspective, a bit like The Legend of Zelda, but with some extra RPG elements added in. It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages.
The game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will
get the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.</desc>

The Victory Gundam's sword attacks in an arc which allows it to deflect airborne attacks and hit flying enemies from the ground. Ultraman?..you know what there's nothing unique about him.

		<name>Great Deal</name>
		<desc>Great Deal combines a pack of cards and Tetris. You must dispose of a 52-card pack(with joker) into a 5x5 well. At the end of the round, you get a bonus if all cards are cleared, and you lose points for each card not cleared. You also get a bonus for stoppage time remaining. Pushing one button shuffles you between four cards, and pushing the other lets you eat up any part of the two minutes' grace period the game awards you per level. You can use it to make sure you drop something in the right place, or to get an idea of what to move next. It's an innovative concept among early Tetris games, trading time for points, and given the potential complexity of the game, it offers a fair amount of relief without spoon feeding the player. Great deal gives you points for 3 suits in a row, or any straight, or 3 of a kind in a row or on a diagonal. You get big points for 4 
or 5.</desc>

		<name>The Great Waldo Search</name>
		<desc>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game of the same name, the player's objective in the FDS version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy's headquarters. Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The FDS version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit.</desc>

		<desc>This golf game comes with pre-designed golf courses in locales such as the U.S.A., Japan, England, Scotland, Germany, Spain, France, Australia, and Hawaii. There is also an opportunity for the player to design their own golf course. The game features variable weather conditions like showers, downpours, wind, and sunshine. The game allows for both strokeplay and matchplay. It also allows for three difficulty levels: novice, amateur, and professional. Practice mode lets the player train on the putting green or on a practice hole.

Gameplay consists of aiming the golf ball and then swinging the chosen golf club. Swinging is done by a meter which measures the power of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices. Putting is done with an overhead view on the green with the meter being used to measure the amount of power that is put on a putt.</desc>

You take the role of the guardian.  Your mission is to activate the station's self-destruct and destroy it before it collides with Earth.

		<name>Gun.Smoke</name>
		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<name>Halley Wars</name>
		<desc>It’s the middle of the 21st century. The armies of Lord Halley are launching attacks on planet Earth. You are the last chance for Earth, piloting a craft specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to commence!

Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.

Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you don’t shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.</desc>

Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions. 

There are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.</desc>

		<desc>Hana no Star Kaidou (which can be loosely translated as "Blossoming Star Highway") is an action game for the Famicom that was developed and published by Victor Musical Industries in 1987. It is about two musicians who dream of obtaining a recording contract and becoming big stars. The player must control both Moero and Goro on the screen at one time. They run, jump, and attack simultaneously. Each one has their own life count, and the game is over as soon as one of them loses all of their lives. Because of the unituitive controls, and unforgiving game mechanics, this game is considered quite difficult and generally not fun to play.</desc>

		<path>./Harry's Legend.7z</path>
		<name>Harry's Legend</name>
		<desc>Harry's Legend is a modification of Titenic based on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (most likely the novel, as the movie came out in 2001) and was made by Hummer Technology, a successor of Hummer Team. Two versions of the game were originally released, both with title screens in English and Chinese - however, both also feature cutscenes written entirely in English. Harry's Legend has become an object of multiple unofficial rereleases, appearing on both multicarts and single game cartridges.

In comparison to Titenic, the gameplay has been somewhat dumbed down. Harry Potter, the only playable character, has got only three non-special attacks: non-comboable standing kick, crouching punch and crouching kick - which means he can't attack while in the air. The inputs for both special attacks remain the same, however, one of them, the broom projectile, isn't available until level two, while the second, the sparkling magic projectile, is only usable since level three.

There are five levels present in Harry's Legend, all of which can be chosen right after the title screen, although all of them have to be completed in order to see the ending. The majority of level layouts have been brought over from Titenic with a few differences in graphics and item placements.

In addition to that, most of the enemies make a return from Titenic, albeit none of them do proper attacks, going for contact damage instead. A few of them, like the animals, don't sport any changes whatsoever, while the human enemies were edited to not handle guns. The only all-new enemies in Harry's Legend are a giant chess piece and an indestructible floating flame. Even though a book-holding ghost also appears in level five, he can't do any damage to Harry normally, and is only here to bounce off the ball.

Each stage ends with a boss - possibly based on professor Quirrel and Voldemort - who has two faces and is constanly walking backwards. Strangely, his death animation always has him fall right down into water, even if it doesn't make sense from the stage's design.

The first segment of stage five, At School, features a volleyball minigame, in which Harry plays against an old lady, and either takes damage by letting the ball into his goal, or does damage to the lady if it gets into her goal.</desc>

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task.

		<name>Hello Kitty No Ohanabatake</name>
		<desc>During the course of this video game, Hello Kitty must water all the flowers in each stage while avoiding the many animals and insects. Kitty's ribbon always stays on the left side of her ear; even if the player changes the orientation of the character.
She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for "game overs." There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage. While the second half of the game is more difficult then the first nine levels, they can be cleared once the player is accustomed to the game controls.</desc>

		<name>Hello Kitty World</name>
		<desc>The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.

Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.

Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play the role of Herakles (or Hercules, in Latin pronunciation), the famous legendary Greek hero. Starting in Athens and wandering all over ancient Greece (and even the mythical land of the dead), you'll have to fight many monsters, including popular figures from Greek mythology like Talos or Hades, and prove yourself worthy of a hero's fame.

The game is very similar to  Dragon Warrior series: you fight random enemies in turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, collect experience and money, and in towns talk to people and buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous location complete with towns and dungeon-like areas.</desc>

		<name>Heracles No Eikou 2 - Titan No Metsubou</name>
		<desc>In this second installment of "Greek mythology" RPG series, the main hero is not the legendary hero Herakles (Hercules), but a young boy from a town Nana, where he lives with his grandmother. The queen tells you that people are being tortured by Titans - an ancient god-like race controlled by the Lord of darkness. You must help to liberate people from the wrath of the Titans. Your first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.

The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Warrior style: you travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it is sometimes necessary to visit them at different times.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Osamu Tezuka's manga "Phoenix", this platformer is mostly based on the fifth volume, "Hō-ō" (later called "Karma" when it reached North America in May 2004). Here you play as the bandit Gaou, who lost an arm and eye as a baby and as such was scorned by his peers. Since then he has resorted to various tactics, not least murder, to survive. However, one day he fought a monk who encouraged him to change his ways and follow his unfound natural talent to sculpt, which is thus put to good use in a variety of sculptures unique in their raw emotion. And then, he meets a fellow sculptor, Akanemaru, who once was attacked by him, and the two engage in encounters with a phoenix, who, it is said, will grant to those who drink its blood eternal life - and the rest is history.</desc>

		<name>Makai Island</name>
		<desc>Higemaru Makaijima (Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed "Makai Island".
In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.
Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.</desc>

Ponkikki was a long-running Japanese children's program similar to Sesame Street; this game features the show's two main characters, Gachapin the dinosaur and Mukku the yeti, in a little friendly competition. Five mini-games repeat over the course of five islands, and each island must be cleared of all five games before proceeding to the next. The set-up is mainly intended for two players, with one player controlling Gachapin and the other Mukku. In one-player mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game other than rock-paper-scissors. Players begin with a limited number of lives which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames; one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also a password system which allows the game to be resumed from any island.</desc>

		<desc>Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi is an RPG - beat-'em-up hybrid that casts you as a novice martial artist that sets out to roam the ancient Chinese countryside in order to hone his skills and earn fame and fortune.

Starting from your village, you must explore your surroundings by walking and jumping across the land in simple side-scrolling fashion, that is until you run across an enemy (fellow martial artists, bandits, ghouls, etc.) and enter combat mode, which allows you to unleash attacks based on your skill level to try and defeat your opponent (always using the 2D side-scrolling engine).

Victory will earn you money and other bonuses which can be used back in town to upgrade your skills and regain health. You can also enter special tournaments found as special buildings across the land in which you must defeat a series of opponents in succession before facing off against the reigning champion. Victory here will reward you with even more money and will mean more people will recognize you in your travels.</desc>

		<name>Hissatsu Shigoto Nin</name>
		<desc>Hissatsu Shigotonin roughly translates to Deadly Work People. I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary "work people" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the gameâ€™s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. Iâ€™m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japanâ€™s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earthâ€™s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.</desc>

		<name>Hit Marmot</name>
		<desc>Hit Marmot is another concoction by Mega Soft, which makes use of the Zapper peripheral. The game is basically a Whack-A-Mole clone, where you choose the game mode and shoot "rats" that pop out of holes on the game board. It is just like any typical shooter game that utilizes the NES Zapper; if you have played Duck Hunt, you already know what to expect here. This game is a bit more fast-paced though, which certainly adds to the difficulty level in later levels. It may be worth checking out if you are a fan of light gun games.</desc>

This time, your initial investigation of a dead body found floating in Tokyo Bay quickly leads you to follow the trail of clues to Hokkaido. There, assisted by local police officer Shunsuke "Shun" Saruwatari, you will visit numerous popular real-life tourist attractions as you attempt to puzzle out the truth behind an ever-expanding series of murders.
While maintaining the same first-person adventure format, this game drops the parser-driven interface used in earlier versions of the preceding title, instead introducing the menu system which was to become typical of Japanese adventure games. The player selects from a number of simple commands to find new evidence and advance the plot; also, the "Examine" command can be used to point at and examine specific spots in the scene pictured.</desc>

		<desc>Randy, the Holy Diver, is setting out to retrieve the five emblem seals belonging to the King Crimson Family in order to expel the greatest evil, the Black Slayer, back into another dimension.

Holy Diver is an action game much in the vein of Castlevania. The player controls the Diver as he uses magic powers such as shooting energy balls and freezing time to traverse the game's eight levels. Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. 

Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</desc>

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.</desc>

		<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

		<name>Hoshi Wo Miru Hito</name>
		<desc>In the far future, the apocalypse has come and gone. Now people leave peacefully in rural cities making the best of the advanced technology that survives and trying to win back the world day by day. Ark City, the crown jewel of technological advances, has managed to put back into operation a super computer capable of taking control of every aspect of civilization, right down to weather and mind control. This does not bode well for the people of the world, so you as an ESP-gifted warrior take it upon yourself to journey to Ark City and get rid of this threat.

Hoshi wo Miru Hito is a classic NES-era RPG, in which you navigate your party (composed of you and 3 other ESP-wielding heroes you can find) in a top-down world map, chat with NPCs in towns, buy weapons and armor, and finally journey into dungeons to gain clues that help you in your journey.

Combat whisks you away from the top-down perspective to a battle view in which you see your opponents and heroes in a first-person perspective, and assign actions in turns, with the ESP powers taking the place of magic spells.</desc>

The object is to use the arrow keys in sync with the pop music in order to score points. Missing too many steps means game over. There are two different forms of "dancing" in this game: single and mix. Single dancing consists of dancing to a single song while mix dancing refers to dancing to multiple songs. Non-dancers can relax with Pac-Man and pinball. Both of these are primitive forms of video games that do not require the massive level of button mashing required in a single game of Hot Dance 2000.</desc>

While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>

		<name>Hydlide 3 - Yami Kara No Houmonsha</name>
		<desc>After the evil dragon lord Varalys tried to enchant the princess Ann, he was thought to be defeated by a brave warrior. But evil can never be defeated once and for all - once again, a curse has fallen upon the land, and you, a nameless young boy, is the only one who can save it. Equipped with your magical sword, you must roam the land of Hydlide and defeat the evil once again.

This is the second NES game of Hydlide series ("Hydlide 2" was only available for the MSX platform). You can choose one of the four character classes to start the game with, and also upgrade your class during the game. The combat is action-based: you can either attack your enemies by ramming them with your weapons, or cast magical spells. In towns there are equipment and items to buy.</desc>

		<desc>I Am A Teacher: Teami no Kiso (roughly "I Am A Teacher: The Basics of Hand-Knitting") is an instructional tool to help would-be knitters create their own garments. The user can input the amount, length and type of wool they have and the size and type of the item of clothing they wish to create and the program will put together a guide to help them achieve this goal. The user can save their progress at any time and pick up from where they left off.

Unlike Super Mario no Sweater, its predecessor in the I Am A Teacher series, there are no Nintendo characters present in Teami no Kiso. Rather, Teami no Kiso is a guide for teaching the fundamentals of knitting to novices, with Super Mario no Sweater intended for those who already have some experience who wish to try new Mario-themed designs.

As with Super Mario no Sweater, Teami no Kiso was commissioned by major Japanese wool and sewing products manufacturer Royal Kougyou, but it's believed that Nintendo developed and published the game themselves.</desc>

		<desc>Fisher-Price: I Can Remember is a card-based game of memory transposed onto the NES. The object is to flip over pairs of cards and find pairs that match. If an unmatched pair is flipped then they get flipped back and the player must remember that data for their next turn. The game has 3 levels, with each having progressively more cards (12, 16, or 20). The cards contain pictures of Fisher-Price toys. Finding matches removes the cards from the screen which then reveals parts of a larger Fisher-Price item.

The game allows a player to play alone, or it allows 2-player competitive play. Further, it also allows human vs. computer competition, where the computer player is named "Electro".</desc>

		<desc>Games end after seven innings unless the two teams have an identical score (tie game). The object is to win the championship using female softball players. Players must choose between the six major high schools from all of the regions of Japan. The artificial intelligence of the game is strong, causing even strong human-controlled teams to frequently lose to the computer. It is possible to throw an underhanded pitch in this game up to 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph).

After winning the Japanese high school championship, the player must take on the American women's softball team before becoming a professional softball player.The game looks similar to a video game that belongs to the Family Stadium baseball video game franchise. Players play their high school games at Hanshin KÅshien Stadium.

If the player loses one game, play starts over unless the player uses a password to return to the previous round. The game's password feature allows games to be replayed and maintains total memory of which teams have already been defeated. However, the passwords and long and very difficult to remember.

Pachio-kun, an anime-like pachinko ball that is famous for starring in the game American Dream (which was made by the same company as I Love Softball), announces the team that will be batting for three outs.</desc>

Each team member can be one of three player types: small and skinny (very fast, but not good at checking or shooting), very large (slow, but with a strong body check and outstanding shooting strength) or average (medium speed, with average checking and shooting strength). After the teams are set up, it's time to play some ice hockey! Gameplay features a scrolling screen to follow the action, and lets you choose which of the players you wish to control when on defense (on offense you always control the player with the puck). Fights can break out between players, and the loser may end up in the penalty box. There are five different speed settings for the game, and periods can be either 7, 10, or 15 minutes long.</desc>

		<name>Idol Hotline - Nakayama Miho No Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

		<name>Igo - Kyuu Roban Taikyoku</name>
		<desc>Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987. 

Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Igo Shinan ("Go Lessons") is a simulation of the popular board game Go from Hect. True to its name, it teaches players at both novice and expert level how to improve their Go game and provides some challenging computer opponents to play against. The player can set how much guidance the game will offer, including presenting possible moves for the player to take (generally, one is more favorable than the others) and allowing the computer to take over their turn. Hect would follow up Igo Shinan with four sequels, each referring to the year in which they were released: Igo Shinan '91, Igo Shinan '92, Igo Shinan '93, and Igo Shinan '94. Igo Shinan, and all its sequels, were only released in Japan. This was and continues to remain standard practice for most video games based on Go or Mahjong, as both board games are far less popular outside of Asia.</desc>

They competed and won at the world stage, it is truly amazing. But did you know, Nekketsu High also has an ice hockey club? Sadly, our team is very weak... We probably won't even make the playoffs in the next national championship. Perhaps Kunio can lead our ice hockey team to victory as well. With him, would it become a successful team, or still be in the minor leagues? Passionate ice hockey spirit! Good luck everyone!</desc>

		<name>Ikinari Musician</name>
		<desc>Ikinari Musician provides a piano-like keyboard, a treble clef on the staff to show note location, a 5-channel Backing track, 4 timbre choices, and controllers to manipulate common synthesizer parameters such as release and attack, LFO, etc. It also provides recording and play back function.

The player has many choices of styles of the backing track, from popular styles such as Rock, Techno, and Jazz, to various ethnic flavors such as Bossa, Rio, Japan, India, Arabia, etc.

The backing tracks representing the styles use familiar elements to make the game more accessible to the general audience. For example, in the Scotland style Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used.

Most backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc.

The keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale.

Due to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune music.</desc>

You will fight against ninjas, samurai and others. The game displays text in the vertical direction, which was very unusual for a game of the period, and all in-game messages use speech reminiscent of jidaigeki movies. The game consists of 4 different levels, the 5th level being an alternate version of the 1st, the 6th being an alternate version of the 2nd, and so on. The difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses, and the game levels rotate endlessly. There is no end screen for the game, and completion of level 99 takes the player to level 00, which is an alternate version of the 4th level. The player returns to level 01 after completing level 00.</desc>

		<path>./Immortal, The.7z</path>
		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

In The Incredible Crash Dummies the player alternates between Slick and Spin as they go through five levels with each level containing 2 stages (except for the 4th level which only consists of one). One of the Dummies' legs has been replaced with a wheel while the other Dummy has his legs intact. So the main difference in gameplay is that in some stages the player either rolls throughout it or walks throughout it. The Dummies' arsenal includes an air gun which stuns enemies at close range and an oil gun which shoots and kills enemies at a far range. There are also a few powerups scattered throughout the stages such as the arrow, balloon, and arm powerup.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.</desc>

		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

		<path>./Ishidou.7z</path>
		<name>Ishido</name>
		<desc>Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.

Every stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol. There are six colors and six symbols in each stone set, thus creating 36 unique stones. Since each stone comes in a pair, there are therefore 72 stones in each stone set.

The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.

Ishido comes with 6 differently themed stone sets, 5 different game boards, and a variety of Oriental chimes and sound effects.</desc>

		<desc>This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</desc>

		<name>Itadaki Street - Watashi No Oten Ni Yottette</name>
		<desc>Itadaki Street is a digital board game similar to Monopoly, from the creator of Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii. Much like its inspiration, players take turns moving around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district. There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain amount of net worth, then return to the bank. Up to four players can play at once, with computer players filling in any empty slots. There are 7 different characters and five different board layouts to choose from.</desc>

Both games feature teams of schoolchildren detectives as they hunt down an elusive thief in a mask and cape.The game follows a sub-genre of Japanese adventure games that include a top-down RPG style world map to walk around on, rather than simply selecting destinations from a menu. Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war, unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but a small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people, would be minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your grenades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, escort them to a safe landing zone and fight a boss battle.</desc>

The Sorcerer had come to rule over China and knew the twins would stand in his way... so he cast a spell to make Josephine disappear. Now it's up to Jackie Chan to follow after the Sorcerer and battle his minions in order to rescue his sister and save China.

Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu is a side-scrolling fighting game. Jackie's controls are one button to jump and another one to attack or be used in combination with a direction for a special attack. On his quest, Jackie must punch and kick his way past frogs, ninjas, birds and other enemies. Jackie can acquire special-moves such as the Tornado attack, the 180 degree spin kick, the 360 degree spin kick and the Sky Attack. Other power-ups include energy refills and bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate.

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.</desc>

Chie the Brat: Bomb daughter finding happiness) is a graphical text-adventure game developed by Konami for the Famicom and published in Japan in 1988. It is a game based on the Jarinko Chie anime and manga about a dependable girl who struggles to help her troublesome father run a small tavern in Osaka. Unbeknownst to her dad, she occasionally visits her mother who left him not too long ago. She plans on trying to reunite them, but not until her father gets a job. The game follows the plotline of several episodes of the anime. Though it is largely text driven, there are moments where the player must play a mini-game in order to advance to the next chapter of the story. Much of the text in the game is presented in traditional Japanese orientation, written top to bottom, and right to left. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated from the original Japanese.</desc>

		<desc>Loosely based on the fourth movie "Jaws: the Revenge", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

If three human players are engaged, then Player 1 and 2 share the first controller, with the second controller going to Player 3.

For the first two rounds, six categories with five questions each are randomly selected by the computer to populate the game board. The contestant who answered the last question correctly gets to pick the category and a dollar value, with harder questions being worth more money. Players have ten seconds from the time a question appears to "ring in" with the appropriate controller button and answer.</desc>

In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.</desc>

Each stage is littered with blue and red arrows: Being the same color as these arrows will magnetize the player character, which has different effects depending on the direction the arrow is pointing: For instance, an arrow pointing down will push the player to the ground if they are the reverse color but a same-colored character can hover across as the blocks will hold them up. Conversely, an arrow pointing up will allow players of the opposite color to jump far higher from the arrow, but will almost entirely eliminate the jumping power of a same-colored character as it pulls them down.</desc>

		<name>Jj - Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2</name>
		<desc>JJ is an action game developed and published by Square for the Famicom in 1987. In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan. The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.</desc>

Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.

		<desc>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?</desc>

He then provides an introductory story for Xuanzang, the main character in Journey to the West, and the Buddha's instruction for Guanyin, where he must find someone to carry the Buddhist sutras back to the east. Xuanzang was chosen for the task of bringing the Buddhist sutras from the West to the east. Guanyin also traveled to find bodyguards for Xuanzang to follow him west. All the companions agreed to serve Xuanzang as a way to atone for past sins. Sun Wukong was the first disciple to join the journey, although his violence was constantly reprimanded by Xuanzang. There are two menus in this game. The first menu is which character to start with, but it's not too important since you can change the character during the game. The second menu appears when you have lost all your lives and have to continue.</desc>

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

The player who does this faster and more accurately will have a better chance of winning the race.

In gamble mode, 1 to 6 players start out with 500 credits to place bets on 5 horses. The race will be simulated without any player interaction, and at the end of each race event players will get their respective prize money. The goal is to earn more money this way than any other player.</desc>

		<name>1999 - Hore, Mita Koto Ka! Seikimatsu</name>
		<desc>Four Japanese high-school students were camping at the countryside, when they suddenly saw an UFO landing nearby. Before they managed to understand anything, a small pink alien with a strict-looking face came out of the space ship and announced that the end of the century is near - and something extraordinary will happen in the year 1999.

That's where the game begins. You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering "yes" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you must help a little boy to become a baseball star. Your goal is to make it through elementary school and high school, to build up his personality (making him more attractive, etc.), and finally let him be drafted by a professional baseball team. All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a "eating" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.</desc>

		<desc>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads. 

The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.</desc>

		<name>The Addams Family : Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : DragonStrike</name>
		<desc>Unlike its namesake on computers, this version of DragonStrike is a straight action game with a top-down perspective. Set during the War of the Lance in the Dragonlance world of Krynn, the player controls dragons in missions against the forces of evil.

At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different attributes in speed and armor and two different breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one. Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.

In two-player mode, the second player (who can select a different dragon) can continue in the mission where the previous player failed.</desc>

		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.</desc>

		<path>./Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Pool of Radiance.7z</path>
		<name>Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.

The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.</desc>

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

		<desc>Your best girl Annabelle has been kidnapped by the evil Gordon, the "gangster king of Bourbon Street", and as Bayou Billy it is your job to get her back! Bayou Billy is an arcade action game with three different types of gameplay: fighting, shooting, and driving. The fighting sections take place in both swamps and cities, where you can punch, kick, and jump kick the numerous enemies (and swamp creatures!) you will encounter. The shooting section can be played with either the Nintendo Light Zapper or the controller. You have a limited amount of ammo to get through the level, and if you run out you lose a life. In the driving section your jeep is armed with machine guns and grenades to help get past the many enemy vehicles on the way to your destination. There is a total of nine levels, or you can play in the practice mode which lets you choose to play a fighting, shooting, or driving round individually.</desc>

		<desc>"You are Captain Comic, galactic hero. Your mission is to recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which have been stolen away and hidden on the remote planet of Tambi."

Captain Comic is a platformer featuring a huge nonlinear playfield divided into several different terrains. As Comic, you must search throughout Tambi for power ups and items that will aid you in your quest to recover the three treasures. The Captain's main weapon is 'Blastola Cola', a can of drink that allows him to hurl fireballs at his foes. For each can that he finds, an additional fireball can be thrown.

There are many different paths that are available from the start, but without the right item or weapon, it can be impossible to progress through certain paths, or even to commit suicide. It's up to the player to decide the correct route to take, and which places to return to at a later time.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island</name>
		<desc>The plot is based on a TV sitcom of the 60's named Gilligan's Island.  Your ship crashed on a deserted island, and now you must get back to civilization.  The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.

Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.

There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.</desc>

		<desc>The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.

Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in total.

The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is an especially hard room with tougher enemies.</desc>

Unlike the two previous Lolo games, Adventures of Lolo 3 lets you wander around a world map to explore different locations in a non-linear fashion. However, some of the locations are blocked and will only open up after you earn the correct a key by completing another level.

The gameplay is very similar to the two previous games. You have to collect all the hearts in each room while avoiding the enemies trying to stop you. Once you have eaten all the hearts, more enemies will appear to try and keep you from reaching the exit. The puzzles involve mostly pushing things to prevent enemies from stopping you.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</desc>

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting.

		<name>Ai Senshi Nicol</name>
		<desc>Ai Senshi Nicol, or "Love Warrior Nicol," tells the story of Nicol, whose sweetheart Stella is taken by a Metroid-like alien while they are on a romantic walk, told in an intro cutscene with hilarious Engrish punctuation. As a result, Nicol decides to take on the entire invading alien race to save Stella, which means he must navigate a bunch of maze-like levels, collecting powerups and hitting switches to progress. Your goal in each stage is to collect three different diamonds to power your hovercraft to the next area, and many are, naturally, guarded by bosses.
Overall it plays a lot like the on-foot parts of Blaster Master, except with tighter design and controls. Each level is structured like a Zelda dungeon, flip screen scrolling and all, where you must explore every available path methodically to uncover secrets and open the next path. It's all action, though, with nary any block puzzles in sight. Much like Metroid, many power-ups have the double feature of giving you extra power or defence while also acting as a "key" to unlocking a new path, such as a gun that destroys a certain type of block, or shoes that let you jump further.</desc>

		<name>Air Fortress</name>
		<desc>The Federation of Intergalactic Powers is under threat by gigantic fortress spaceships which have suddenly appeared and destroyed nearby civilization. When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special "Lightship". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.

The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.

Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</desc>

		<path>./Airball.7z</path>
		<name>Airball</name>
		<desc>irball is a computer game released in 1987 by Microdeal. It was programmed by Ed Scio, with graphics by Pete Lyon, music by Paul Shields, and level design by Pete Scott. Lyon was the artist for other Microdeal games in the late 1980s, such as Goldrunner. A version for the NES was under development by Novotrade and Tengen (without a Nintendo license), but cancelled. Can You Outwit the Wizard? You have no time to lose! An evil wizard has transformed you into a fragile ball with a tiny hole that is gradually leaking precious air. Trapped in a huge mansion of over 150 rooms, you must watch out for hidden dangers that threaten to puncture your delicate skin while you desperately seek rooms which contain airpumps to replenish your dwindling supply. But pay close attention to your pressure gauge. As long as you remain on the pump your internal pressure will continue to rise and will cause you to explode if you don't break away in time! It's a race against time and your only hope is to find the evil wizard's spellbook which contains the secret to regaining your human form. Can you outwit the wizard before he deflates your existence?</desc>

You play a young detective who investigates a strange case: eight people have disappeared, and rumors are heard about a mysterious Ghost Train. You head to a remote village to learn more about those events. In this adventure game, you can move your hero from third-person perspective, but you can leave a screen only via a menu command. The menu is unique to each location; in some of them, you'll be able to investigate a room by moving around a cursor and clicking on objects, while in others you'll talk to people about various topics.</desc>

		<name>Akira</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the animé movie of the same name. The year is 2019, 31 years after World War III. The events of the game (and of the movie) take place in a futuristic city called New Tokyo, which is controlled by corrupted military and rival gangs. You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the "examine" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.</desc>

		<desc>Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.

You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.</desc>

You are to study the art of summoning and to fulfill the prophecy. Your first quest is to locate Cerberus, the watch dog of hell.

"Akuma-kun" is a RPG with turn-based combat. You travel on the world map and visit towns, where the perspective changes to platform. The unusual feature of the game is the ability to summon demonic creatures to your party (called nakama) and to make them fight by your side, similar to  Megaten games.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2734, the mechanical life form Garemu suddenly attacked five hyperspace navigation broadcasting points, "FIELD". In order to prevent Garem's invasion, the Milky Way alliance has decided to dispatch the mobile weapon Raijin, which you must pilot. Like Square's earlier semi-classic Thexder, the player can opt to change between the two modes of their craft at certain points during each level. Upon touching ground as the mecha, the player is occasionally able to find other directions to continue exploring as a spaceship, presenting both vertical-scrolling and side-scrolling shoot-'em-up sections. There are three items you must find before you complete a level; a star, an orb, a computer, and a bomb. After you collect all of these, it will trigger the boss battle the next time you try to go to the boss area.</desc>

		<name>Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing</name>
		<desc>Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer  Al Unser Jr., this game depicts Formula 1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of "set-up points", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents).

While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.</desc>

		<name>Aladdin 2</name>
		<desc>Like Aladdin by Super Game, this game is a port of the Mega Drive version of Aladdin. This port is often considered to be much worse than those two, suffering from poor programming, controls and collision detection, as well as numerous other flaws. The story was completely omitted from this game, apart from an ending being present. Upon starting the game the player is given the option to start on any of the 8 levels that this game has.
All of the levels are based off those from the original game. The controls are awkward, with the player having to press Select to throw apples. The hit detection is poor, with attacks that clearly hit the enemy not registering much of the time. The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.

The graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a "The End" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.</desc>

		<name>Magic Carpet 1001</name>
		<desc>Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.
The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.
As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.
Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.
This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.</desc>

The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<name>Alien 3</name>
		<desc>Alien³ on the NES is similar to Probe Software's adaptations of the film on other systems. While using the same overall game concept as the Sega and Commodore versions, the NES title has unique levels.

The player controls Ripley through a number of platform levels. She must not only defend herself against hordes of aliens and find the exit, but also save a number of prisoners, all within a tight time limit of only minutes per level.

Weapons to use against the aliens include a pulse rifle, flame thrower, grenade launcher as well as hand grenades. Ammo for each is limited and must be collected in the levels. The rifle is prone to overheating, so should only be fired in short bursts.

Next to health packs, Ripley can also find a radar. The radar indicates both moving aliens as well as the locations of prisoners.

After every two levels, a guardian level follows, in which an especially tough alien must be defeated to continue.</desc>

		<desc>Video round ball seems to come in a variety of court sizes and player numbers. All-Pro Basketball combines five-on-five full-court action with a half-court screen view.

All-Pro style B-ball features several different play options. Go head-to-head with a friend in a one-game contest. Or, watch two computer teams battle it out on court. If you choose league competition your task is to lead your team to the league championship. In Two Player league play you and a buddy team up to battle the computer teams. Choose your squad from eight professional rosters - ranging from the New York Slicks to the San Francisco Bayriders. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When the scene is set, the game begins with a jump ball and then it's non-stop no-holds-barred B-ball. On offense you're the team - running, jumping, jump passing, shooting, and even going for three pointers or slam dunks. On defense make a steal or grab a rebound. And remember this is real video basketball. You get called for fouls and your teammates get tired. When their health and stamina get low it's up to you to put them on the bench for a rest.</desc>

Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

		<desc>This game has two modes: story and tournament. Tournament mode is the simpler one: you compete against seven opponents in a quiz that concerns various historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects of United States of America. Some questions require you to choose "yes" or "no", while others present you a short list of possible answers, of which you should choose the correct one. The participants' responses are timed.

In the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game. For example, in one of the competitions answering a question involves running through a football field and making it to the correct part of the touchdown area, which is divided into large "yes" and "no" sections.</desc>

The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. 

Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.</desc>

		<name>Titanic Mystery - Ao No Senritsu</name>
		<desc>Titanic Mystery (lit. Titanic Mystery: Shiver of Blue) is an underwater exploration game developed by Activision and published by Gakken in 1987 for the Family Computer Disk System. It has a female protagonist that the player controls while searching sunken ships.

The game is slightly famous for its instruction booklet which contains a short manga-style story. Despite the fact that most Famicom users at this time were children, this manga story features the protagonist in a shower scene. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor was it ever translated from Japanese.</desc>

Unlike previous versions of Little Computer People, the playable character is a girl wearing a pink dress and bow in her hair. The rooms of the house are also in a different configuration, featuring an outdoor balcony on the top floor. When the game is first played, a name for the character is chosen at random from a preprogrammed list. There are no winning conditions on this game you basically watch and interact with the girl in various ways. However, Apple Town Story lacks many of the features found in other versions of Little Computer People.</desc>

		<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

The game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship.  Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

All the elves hope lies in one elf warrior named Christine.  Equipped in the beginning with only a bow, she proceeds to find the ring and restore her home back to normal.

This is a game that may be compared to The Legend of Zelda, though more linear in it's game play. The game is broken down into many stages, the goal of each being to simply find a way into the next stage.  Playing out in puzzle fashion, you will shoot all the enemies on screen, earn the hidden key, and find the correct exit.  Defeated enemies will randomly drop bonuses that can be collected; these items include health restore, increased armor, and weapon improvements.

Beating the entire game requires successful progression through 125 stages.</desc>

The matters become even more complicated when the famous Billy The Shell also embarks on a quest to save Sheryl. Will Armadillo be able to rescue the girl and to defeat his enemies?

In this game, you move Armadillo around an area map composed of squares. Some of them are empty, while others represent locations. Once you enter a location, you find yourself on a platform level, that often contains several sub-levels. There are sometimes branching ways on the area map, and you are not obliged to access all the locations to clear an area. On the platform levels, Armadillo can either walk and jump in his normal form (dies from single enemy hit), or turn into a ball, which is invulnerable to enemies' attacks, but is hard to control: the ball follows realistic physics, bounces of walls, and takes time to stop rolling. During the game, Armadillo will also be able to find upgrades that will allow him to take an animal's form for a short time.</desc>

Many people were sucked into it an transported into another dimension, which they named Artelius. It was ruled by the evil king Sarbelor, who constructed a machine named Galax, which tore the dimension into lonely asteroid-filled spaces accessed by warp points. The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.

This game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels ("classes") and become stronger.</desc>

The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.

This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.</desc>

		<desc>Aspic is the sequel to one of Xtalsoft's earlier games, Lizard. Aspic begins right where Lizard ends. The player obtains the Book of Truth, which is needed to break the curse on the princess. He returns to the king only to find that the princess is missing. Three days prior, a wizard appeared and informed the king that there was another way to save the princess, so the king entrusted the princess's life to the wizard. Now that you've returned, the king begs you to find out what's become of the wizard and the princess.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, almost entirely... One small Gaulish village continues to defy the occupying forces, the villagers protected by a magic potion which makes them invincible. But now Obelix has vanished! The Romans have confirmed his capture and taken him to an unknown destination. 

Astérix is a platform game based on the eponymous comic books, where the short and mustached Gaul has to progress through levels located all across Europe, fighting Romans and various aggressive animals along the way, to rescue his friend Obelix before Caesar throws him to the lions....</desc>

		<desc>Somewhere in the galaxy lies the planet RS-121 – a desolate planet that has suffered terrible disasters which made life impossible. Only one construction still remains on the planet – a highway called Black Line. It is said than an ancient legend is somehow connected to this highway. You, a man named Riber, decide to participate in a racing competition on the Black Line. But be ready – the competition can bring deadly results...

In this racing game, you drive your car on the highway through pseudo-3D environments. The opponents will not hesitate to push you outside the road. You can either squeeze between them (pressing the Down button will make your car smaller), or shoot at them with a limited amount of missiles. On the way there will be shops where you'll be able to repair and upgrade your car.</desc>

		<path>./Astro Robo Sasa.7z</path>
		<name>Astro Robo Sasa</name>
		<desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.</desc>

As in its role model, you fly towards the screen or run on the ground, rendered in a checkered 3D field. The hero has been replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships, asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.</desc>

		<desc>Based off the cartoon show of the same name, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes places young Chad Finletter on a quest to make his way past evil mutant tomatoes and stop the crazy Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</desc>

The hero must escape the various rooms of the biblical structure while collecting treasure. Each room is a separate puzzle, where the main objective is to pick up and stack L-shaped building blocks to construct stairs or bridges and reach the exit door. In each of these rooms, the player has a limited number of times that they can pick up these building blocks. The player must also avoid touching roaming enemies like flying bats, golems and the priest guards. When the explorer gets stuck or the level is made unsolvable by a series of wrong actions, a button can be used to kill the main character and reset the room.</desc>

		<name>Back To The Future</name>
		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to the world of Bad News Baseball, a place where rabbits serve as umpires, home runs escape the earth's atmosphere, and batters are knocked unconscious when they make an out.

Bad News Baseball is a Japanese import for a younger audience. The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</desc>

Although it's seems kind of strange, the game is just that: walk around the street as a wrestler wannabe and beat up grannies, blind men, gorillas and other bystanders. But try not to get beaten as the granny attempts to give you some of your own medicine by flailing her purse at you.

Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.</desc>

		<name>Baken Hisshou Gaku - Gate In</name>
		<desc>Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In (or "Horse Betting Certain Victory School: Gate In") is a horse racing simulation game for the NES/Famicom. The idea is that there are a large number of parameters that you can adjust, such as how long a race is, where it is held, the lineage of the horses, the natural temperament of the horses, and so on. After setting as many parameters as you like, you can start the race and see which horse wins. There is no winning or losing from your perspective (none of the horses are "yours", and you don't get to place any bets or anything), you just change parameters and see what happens. The idea is that this game will teach you how to do well at betting on horse racing by letting you play with parameters and experiment to find what are considered the important conditions that determine what makes a horse do well in a race. There are no ending credits or anything, there is no condition to "beat the game". There are no seasons. It is simply adjust parameters and start the race, repeat ad nauseam.</desc>

		<desc>This game is a humorous "star simulation", or, better to say, a strategy game with elements of luck, in which your goal is to become a famous musician or a star of the Japanese theater, particularly succeeding in monomane, a technique of imitation. There are four characters in the game which are controlled by players or computer. The turns of the game are determined by a roll of dice. The characters are located on a city map, and move around it according to the number that their dice rolled, somewhat similarly to monopoly-type board games. Each time you stop, you access a location where various things happen: you can select theater pieces and perform on stage, try to impress people, etc. Sometimes you land on a location that leads to a mini-game (swimming, playing ball, and others). Winning such a game gives an additional boost to your career.</desc>

		<desc>In "Bakushou!! Ai no Gekijou", you create one to four characters. You choose their name and gender, as well as their parents (from several available ones). This determines the personality and the abilities of your characters (their intelligence level, physical condition, etc.). You then guide your teenager characters through a series of typical events. For example, at the beginning you'll be in school and will have to solve simple mathematical exercises. After that, you are presented with a calendar, which is your board in the game. You cannot control the actions of the characters, but depending on the way you have created them, and on the day the game will randomly choose for you, events will occur in their life, some of which are completely ordinary (like going out and meeting someone), while others will grant your characters more intelligence, physical condition, or let them earn or spend money. The game will also determine what personal relationship the characters will have with each other, and whether a romantic involvement is possible.</desc>

Four characters participate in the game, one of which is controlled by you, and the others either by the computer AI, or by other players. In the beginning, all your characters are at a "starting position", on a map that is composed of circles, some of which are empty, while others represent a building or a certain event. A roll of dice determines how many moves the character will make. Depending on the circle the character steps on, different things will occur. Random circles will take you to a journey or depict a simple day spent with your family. Others will add money to the character, or make him train and raise his physical condition, etc. The characters move over the entire board, living their lives, visiting school, meeting with each other, etc.</desc>

The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board. Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect of a person's life. For example, "learning" tiles will trigger an event that will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a tile with a "love" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love level of the character.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou" series follows the same principles as the first two. It is a board game that simulates the lives of up to four characters. You can create all the characters on your own, let the computer AI handle them, or play with other players. You move your character(s) through the game world (it doesn't look like a board, like in the first two games, but still works the same way). The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll. Unlike the first two games, there are no special icons on the board, all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.</desc>

In the game, players attempt to destroy each others tanks. If a tank is destroyed, the driver of the tank will exit the vehicle, and must try to stay alive long enough for a replacement tank to parachute down from the sky. Game play continues until only one tank is the sole survivor. Then players advance to a new stage with different terrain. There are 56 stages in total. Tank stats can also be changed in an Editor mode. Despite referencing the name of American General George S. Patton in the title, there is no mention of him anywhere else throughout the game. Although the game was only release in Japan, the loading screen instructions contain English profanity.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer!

Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.

The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 

The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.

Scoring

Close-in goals - 1 point
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
OTH shots - 3 points
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</desc>

		<desc>In this puzzle game, you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

		<name>Bandai Golf : Challenge Pebble Beach</name>
		<desc>One or Two players can play a round on this video course modeled after the real Pebble Beach. Each player can select their own handicap. Every one of the 18 holes has familiar golf hazards - bunkers, slopes, and water hazards. You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.

Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</desc>

		<name>Bandit Kings of Ancient China</name>
		<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu.  The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler.  You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China.  You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles.  You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

		<path>./Barcode World.7z</path>
		<name>Barcode World</name>
		<desc>This video game was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 1992 for the Nintendo Family Computer. As the title suggests, it is a video game where players use a Barcode Battler II (a card-scanning handheld) together with a Nintendo-licensed Famicom-Barcode Battler interface that came packaged with the game and not sold separately. A special set of Barcode Battler cards with barcodes imprinted on them were also required to play the game including the "White Card" that enabled players to scan any barcode (especially ones found on consumer products).

Barcode World includes barcode cards that feature characters from many Sunsoft series, most notably Hebereke and Gimmick!, however using the White Card included with the game, players were also given the ability to scan a wide range of consumer products. Released during a period of great interest in barcode-swiping games in Japan, the game dates itself as directly from the early 1990s, however the game still functions today exactly as it did then and modern products may also be scanned in order to generate new content for the game (RPG-style stats and attributes, etc.).</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to the popular RPG Bard's Tale. After your characters defeated the wizard Mangar the Dark and freed Skara Brae from eternal winter, all seemed well in the world. Fortunately for your employment prospects, the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta shows up and splits the Destiny Wand into seven pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for 700 years, and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon your party to reforge the Destiny Wand. Also, one among you must ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth Zanta.

Bard's Tale 2 uses the same engine as the original with similar gameplay, but takes place in a much larger game world, featuring several different cities (instead of just Skara Brae). You can generate new characters or import characters from the previous Bard's Tale.</desc>

Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues. You are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins...</desc>

		<name>Cyber Stadium Series : Base Wars</name>
		<desc>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.</desc>

As the manager you build up your team by allocating a set bunch of points for batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding ability among your players. Then, you customize your pitching staff by divvying up points for ERA, speed, right and left curve balls, sinking pitches, and stamina. Your managerial responsibilities also include deciding who's right-handed and who's a lefty, and whether your pitchers throw overhand or sidearm.

You can also play in the Ultra League. Ultra League play enables you to give your hitters and pitchers special skills, such as the ability to pitch balls that zig zag, or hit balls that explode on contact.</desc>

		<name>Bases Loaded</name>
		<desc>Bases Loaded is a baseball action game for one or two players featuring a large variety of options and realistic graphics and sound. You can select from twelve different teams and choose a lineup for each team. Each team has 30 players with different characteristics to learn. During gameplay you can control all of the positions in the field and pitch everything from a fast ball to curve ball. When at bat you can try to hit a homerun, bunt, or steal bases. Play can be a single game or a complete pennant.</desc>

		<desc>Bases Loaded 3 was Jaleco's latest entry into the popular baseball series in 1991. Changes over the previous title included slightly more detailed fielders, a new field perspective (home plate at the top of the screen, center field at the bottom), an editable team, and a new goal: to play the perfect game of baseball against the computer. Simply winning the game was no longer enough; the gamer now had to avoid common baseball missteps such as making an error and striking out, in order to earn a perfect rating. Against the very clever computer pitching, this could prove quite difficult.</desc>

Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.

Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

		<desc>In this version of Bases Loaded you coach your team through a 130-game season in either an Eastern or western division of a professional baseball league. Win the pennant and you're off to the World Series! You can also play head-to-head with a friend.

Choose from six teams in each division. Once you take your place in the dugout you're the manager, juggling your own lineup and battling order. You'll also have to somewhat of a psychologists as you learn to interpret the Player Performance Ratings. This unique feature of Bases Loaded II rates each player in three categories: physical, sensitivity, and intellectual. Each rating is like a biorhythm, going up and down, just like in real life. The Player Performance Ratings simulate what players really go through - streaks and slumps.
Bases Loaded II also features similar realistic on-field action that was present in the first game of the series.</desc>

		<desc>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game is loosely based on the 1989 movie. It is a side-scrolling game with a blue-dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas, and mutants.

The game consists of five levels: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (boss: Machine Intelligence System), Underground Conduit (boss: Electrocutioner), the Laboratory Ruins (boss: Dual-Container Alarm) and Gotham's Cathedral (boss: Firebug) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene is shown using scenes from the movie.</desc>

		<name>Batman : Return of the Joker</name>
		<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</desc>

		<desc>Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.

In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.

Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.

The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</desc>

Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</desc>

		<desc>Battletank is an advanced tank simulator where players take control of a tank from its driver's seat. Players are stuck straight in the tank and sent off to the battlefield in order to accomplish the mission they are assigned to.  

Mission objectives.can be anything from eliminating the enemies to destroying the enemy fuel dump to taking out an enemy camp.  However dangerous enemies lurk all over the battlefield.  Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block your moves.  These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank, leading to difficulties.  

However, many strategic elements are involved.  The first-person mode offers a limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield.  Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank is cooked!</desc>

The most notable difference is that multiple weapons can be used. Each ship carries a special weapon that can fire many missiles many points across a set grid, for instance in an X pattern.

Call the Starcops? NO! Cause you're a Battletoad! Battletoads don't cry, hide or call for help! And they certainly don't whimper! They get MAD then they get EVEN! So grab your blaster, hop on the Toadster and go get 'em!

You will control a battletoad through various levels. Some are side-scrolling beat-em-ups, other are vertical drops down a shaft, fighting as you go, others have you riding a rocket or surfboard, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.</desc>

Spiders, grasshoppers, assorted bugs, and even lawn sprinklers are all over the place and try to stop bee 52 from reaching the many flowers where honey can be collected. Even after collecting honey, you may need to defend your nest against ants who will try to sneek in and steal honey from you. Bee 52 is armed, however, and can sting or shoot many of the enemies that get in the way. Some levels even have bugs that, when shot, will provide bee 52 with more powerful firepower temporarily. Bee 52 is a side scrolling shooter which can be played by one or two players.</desc>

		<desc>This is a Bible trivia/action game in which you spin a spinner and move the number of spaces it says. 

When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, upgraded or better weapons, hearts, etc. If the space you land on has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of  three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces. 

When you spin, if you don't get a number but instead get the book, you get a pop quiz of three questions. If you get the happy face, something good happens like move ahead ten space, get a key, get a heart, etc. If you get the sad face, something bad happens like lose your turn, move back 1 space and lose turn, etc. 

When you take a quiz, if you answer all three questions right, you get a star.

At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars and/or collected the most food then all the points are shown for each player.</desc>

Joy Mecha Fight is a one-on-one 2D fighter, in which you control a robot and attempt to defeat your opponent by attacking him with your basic moves and special attacks triggered by specific control motions.

		<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

Just Breed is a hybrid of traditional console-style RPG like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, and strategy RPG. During confrontations with the enemies, the battle screen occupies the entire location, and large parties of allies and enemies fight each other in turn-based style, moving on the field to perform physical attacks (melee as well as ranged) or to cast magic spells.</desc>

		<name>Kaguya Hime Densetsu</name>
		<desc>The legend of Kaguya-hime is one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology. Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as "look", "take", or "use" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under "extras", such as "kiss", "attack", and even "undress".</desc>

		<path>./Kaijuu Monogatari.7z</path>
		<name>Kaijuu Monogatari</name>
		<desc>Kaijuu Monogatari ("Shell Creature Story") is an 8-bit RPG for the NES that more than superficially resembles Enix's Dragon Quest. As with many RPG contemporaries for the system, it borrows the basic premise (talk to the King, discover what to do next, fight some evil force) and the turn-based tactical combat and gradual character development of its major influence, but also much of its aesthetic: The box art has some Akira Toriyama-inspired artwork and the protagonist wears a familiar suit of blue armor. Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.
The plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack.
A unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level.
The game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.</desc>

		<name>Kaiketsu Yancha Maru 2 - Karakuri Land</name>
		<desc>One day, a mysterious theme park called Karakuri Land appeared in Edo. In it were various mechanical attractions, built around different themes. Many people went to visit, and the park was very popular. The princess asked Yanchamaru if he would like to go with her, but since he was busy with his training, she went by herself. However, she didn't come back, and so Yanchamaru must make his way through the oddly-aggressive attractions to find and rescue the princess!

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 is the sequel to Kid Niki, and once again stars the big-headed, sword-spinning, headband-sporting fighter Yanchamaru. Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end. Yanchamaru has his trusty spinning sword, and can also find bonus items to improve his abilities and increase his score.</desc>

Locked in a tower, she manages to write a plea for help on a scrap of paper and then sends a paper airplane out of her prison. Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a bo, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.

Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.</desc>

It is based on Bandai's Kamen Rider franchise, a weekly science fiction story created by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Sh?nen Magazine, as well as being aired on television. The story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.</desc>

However, an unscrupulous merchant is attempting to capture Kantarou and steal his explosive technique secrets.

Tokaido Gojuusan Tsugi is a horizontally scrolling action game developed by Sunsoft in 1986. It was never released outside of Japan. On June 29, 2001, the game was released for the Windows platform as part of Sunsoft Classic Games 2 along with Ikki (which was itself rereleased as a budget title in 2004). On December 27, 2001, the game was released on the PlayStation as part of Memorial Series: Sunsoft Vol. 3 along with The Wing of Madoola.</desc>

		<path>./Kart Fighter.7z</path>
		<name>Kart Fighter</name>
		<desc>This game can be purely considered the 'illegal' predecessor of Super Smash Bros., since it's, ironically, Street Fighter II with Mario Kart characters. All in all, it copies the mechanics of Street Fighter II in almost everything, starting from the moves and ending with combo system.

Like in Mario Kart, there is an overall of eight characters to choose from, starting with Mario, going through Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Koopa, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr. and, finally, Bowser, whom you have to defeat two times during the arcade play. Most of the character roster is being a huge bunch of shotoclones, with one of the few exceptions being Peach, who has Chun-Li's moveset, Koopa, who has some sort of a 'kamikaze' projectile and Donkey Kong who throws a ground projectile, similar to Terry's Power Wave.

The game has original sprites and music, although some graphics were obviously reused from such games as Little Nemo: The Dream Master and Wario Land 4, not to say about the use of the graphics from Mario games themselves.

Like in many games based on the same engine (along with NES Street Fighter II port by the same developers), this has the two-player mode, apart from the contrary belief, by pressing the A button on the second gamepad during player select sequence.</desc>

		<desc>Keiba Simulation: Honmei ("keiba" is the Japanese word for horse-racing, and "honmei" is a term meaning a favorite to win) is a Famicom horse-racing simulation game from Nichibutsu, often known as Nihon Bussan. In fact, the box art states the former as developer and the title screen states the latter. As a true simulation game, there is no racing (at least that the player can control) or gambling. The player instead can fiddle with the parameters for each race and the horses competing, changing their stats such as fatigue, age and the weight of the jockey. Then players can watch a race with these settings play out and observe the winner. It is possible the goal of this game is to recreate the likely output of an actual race based on as much information as the player is able to muster in order to assist them with their gambling, though its more likely the game is for racing enthusiasts.</desc>

		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

		<name>Kid Icarus</name>
		<desc>Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the Princess of Angel Land.

Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!

Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. 

The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. 

Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 

Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.</desc>

		<desc>Kid Klown and his family are on their way to perform in a circus when they meet the magician Night Mayor. He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World is a side-scrolling platformer. Kid Klown has to complete several different stages inhabited by various enemies. His most helpful tools are his balloons that he can throw at his enemies, use as a trampoline or cling to in order to float through the air. 

There are various items to be picked up as well, including bonus lifes, health power-ups, strawberries, lightnings that make Kid Klown temporarily invincible and question marks that can have the same effect as any of the other items, but might also reverse the controls.

After every completed stage, a bonus game can be played in which Kid Klown may win items by throwing balloons at them. The number of balloons available depends on the number of strawberries collected in the previous stage.</desc>

		<name>Kid Kool and the Quest for the Seven Wonder Herbs</name>
		<desc>Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer.  The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.

Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.  There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.

Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</desc>

		<name>Patlabor The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!</name>
		<desc>Patlabor - The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant. In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.

Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.

The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</desc>

		<name>Kieta Princess</name>
		<desc>The Kingdom of Rabia's princess goes missing during a visit to Japan, surrounding the investigation of the medicine to an "epidemic dementia," known as "Oninofuguri", and the prevention of its importing. The player takes the role of a detective determined to unravel the mystery of the missing princess Kilala, in this RPG style adventure game. Yasuko Tomita served as the model of one of the characters. Certain telephone numbers would appear, which, if called, would provide the player with a hint, spoken by Yasuko Tomita.

In order to track down Kobayashi, the criminal protagonist, you must visit five different towns and collect information. Neary every house and building can be entered, which was unique for its time. The game also features a high degree of freedom, allowing you to visit restaurants for a bite, or a Dojo to train, or to hunt for vegetation to sell for money, while you are looking for the princess.

Another introduced concept that was novel for its time was the notion of day and night changing the appearance of the city. During the evening, you may encounter a street gang, and they may open fire on you, although you can defend yourself with a revolver. However, if over 20 innocent people are gunned down, you will be arrested and sent to the police station where you must pay a fine and return to the starting point.

The degree of difficult throughout the game is considered quite high, with very few hints to help you out, while other hints are misleading. For example, one hint suggests that you if you sleep over night at a particular crossroad in a city, you will get a key item, but this hint is false. Although you are supposedly a detective, you never actually get to accuse anyone of a crime.</desc>

It appears to be based off Street Fighter Zero 2 '97, having several of the same issues that it has such as garbled sprites on the top of the screen during fights, two repeats of each character (this is the same case in SFZ2'97) as well as having numerous sound effects reused from it. Both games also use the same VS screen music. Unlike that game though, this has a difficulty setting, and retains the team mode that the actual King of Fighters games have. There are only 7 characters in this game, much fewer than the original game's roster. There's no POW bar in this game, unlike the original, making it play more like Street Fighter II. The ending is a cutscene of Goenitz being defeated, however it is in English, with one of the lines (FIGHTER KING OF FIGHTERS 98 I'M BACK TO TRAINING EVERY DAY AND I'M KICKING BUTT) randomly taken from the Fatal Fury Team's ending from the original game.</desc>

		<desc>This cartridge contains three adventures. Your life meter is displayed as scrolls and when you are hit, you lose a half a scroll. When all the scrolls are gone, your game is over. You can collect additional scrolls in the game but to get the scroll, you will need to correctly answer a Biblical question.

In The Wise Men, you are the camel taking the wise men to Bethlehem to see the baby Jesus. Along the way, in addition to scrolls, you can gather gold, frankincense and myrrh for points. You can run and jump and spit water balls at your enemies. You can also collect fruits that can be used against enemies. Fruits are more powerful than water balls and some enemies can only be destroyed with fruits.</desc>

This version removes most alternate solutions to puzzles and does not allow many actions that would render the game unwinnable. It also shortens and eliminates several scenes; for example, it is impossible to revisit the wizard in the first house. A few locations (such as the desert) are smaller. Some death sequences have been removed or modified not to include words related to death; also, some text descriptions were altered.</desc>

The first Kinnikuman game (released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in the US) was a straightforward wrestling game, but this sequel changes the action to a side-scrolling action brawler game with additional RPG and story elements. The main character can still use wrestling moves on enemies, but most of the attacks are simple punches and kicks.Curiously, the boss music is a sped up version of "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly.</desc>

Wiebenson pitched Kitty's Catch to several publishers, all of which refused to publish the game. Eventually, several prototypes were discovered and purchased in a lot by the Nolan brothers, who released the most complete ROM to the public.
Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of the time limit wins. There are also several power-ups obtained by collecting tin cans, such as larger hooks.</desc>

		<name>Kiwi Kraze : A Bird-Brained Adventure!</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

		<desc>Knight Lore is a a 3D isometric adventure game by Jaleco, originally released by the British game company Ultimate. Saberman, the hero of the game, has been cursed by an evil wizard. Every night, he turns into a creepy werewolf and he is on a journey to retrieve all the necessary ingredients to create a magic potion. This potion, he hopes, will get him to return to his human shape. The game starts in a dark forest, somewhere in there the wizard awaits for the potion's ingredients such as diamonds, bottles etc... Our hero's task is to wander around and find them, one at the time, and bring them back to him. But our hero must watch out, he turns into a werewolf at night and the wizard won't hesitate to use his magic against him. Saberman must make sure to always approach him as a human. Up to three items can be carried at the same time, they can also be dropped on the ground and climbed to reach higher platforms. However, once a new ingredient is delivered to the wizard, our hero leaves empty handed and lose all stored items. Series of enemies and hazards are of course scattered along his path, such as spirits, spikes or pits. Once all the ingredients are collected, the game jumps to another location where more objects need to be found with meaner hazards and enemies. This is also the point where the player's progress can be saved.</desc>

		<path>./Knight Move.7z</path>
		<name>Knight Move</name>
		<desc>The game is based around the concept of how a knight piece is moved in the game of chess. The player controls a knight chess piece that is constantly jumping and must continually choose which of the possible legal moves to make before the knight lands back on the board.

When the knight lands on any square on the board, it turns from white to light teal. Landing there again, turns it dark teal. Landing there yet again destroys the square altogether, leaving a hole that the player must avoid. Falling in a hole will result in a game over. Consecutively creating several holes results in a chain increasing the player's score in differing increments.

At the beginning of each "round", a heart is placed somewhere on the board. A heart (or multiple hearts) must be collected to advance to the next round, which thereby replaces all holes on the board with new white squares and places a new heart somewhere on the board. Depending on the game mode, hearts will sometimes move themselves every few jumps of the knight.

The player can also gather a small amount of extra points, at any time, by holding the A button and speeding up the knight's movement. The main objective in Knight Move is to continue this cycle, despite the increasing game speed, and reach the highest score possible.

The game also includes a simultaneous 2 player versus mode similar to the single player modes.</desc>

All teams are fictional but based out of real Canadian and American cities. The game is known for its fast paced hockey action and especially for the fighting. It is a one or two player game. When playing against the computer, there are three difficulty levels to choose from: Junior, College, and Pro (with Pro being the most difficult and Junior being the easiest). Each team consists of three forwards, two defense men, and a goaltender.</desc>

		<name>Konamic Tennis</name>
		<desc>Konamic Tennis is part of a long line of Konami sports games made specifically for the Famicom and its Famicom Disk System peripheral, which had previously used the term "Exciting" to signify its Konami status: As is the case with games such as Exciting Baseball or Exciting Basketball (known in the west as Double Dribble). Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the "Konamic" appellation; a portmanteau of "Konami" and "dynamic". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.

Konamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.

One feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.</desc>

		<desc>Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986 by Pony Canyon and the NES in 1987. It is actually a movie license title based on the cinema release of Koneko Monogatari, better known in the United States as The Adventures of Milo and The video game representation of this movie is quite different, and regretfully slow. It gives the player control over the kitten Milo, as he attempts to navigate through a side scrolling world of trees, hostile animals, and other obstacles. Milo plods along at a very slow pace, and can jump from tree branch to tree branch, popping fruit out from the leaves, which he must collect before they turn rotten and disappear. Every moving object from mice to beetles, is lethal to Milo and must be avoided. Fruit can be dropped on enemies for extra points. Eggs can be collected to use as weapons which must be dropped on enemies. Bottles of milk grant temporary invincibility. And if the player manages to collect four eggs that spell out the word HELP, Otis will appear to attack enemies that are headed Milo's way. However, touching Otis will also kill Milo..</desc>

You are the only one who can save the world, but you need to be strong and to find comrades, such as cat-like fighters from a nearby town, to help you on your difficult quest. 

Loosely based on an animé series Villgust, the game is a mixture of traditional RPG with platform fighting. Every time you encounter an enemy, you have two options: combat and auto-combat. Auto-combat makes you and the enemies attack in turn-based style, without you being able to interfere. If you choose the combat option, a platform pops out, on which you and your enemies appear. Both your party and the foes can jump and attack in close combat and from a distance.</desc>

The gameplay and artistic style are heavily influenced by the NES Mega Man games (some contend the elements are "borrowed" or "stolen", in fact). The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels.

They discover that in their absence, Princess Min-min has been kidnapped and the 10 treasures of the kingdom stolen. Jacky and Lee must fight their way into eight different castles in order to defeat the monsters and rescue the princess.

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.</desc>

New graphic features include weather effects and different courts to play in. As with the original the game supports 4-player gameplay and includes a league mode (1P tournament), Vs and a special penalty shootout vs mode.</desc>

Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).

It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.

However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?

Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.

By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.

All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.</desc>

It was released for the Family Computer (or Famicom; known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System) by Angel Studios, and published by Toei. It is a side-scrolling action game in which the player takes control of a different Zyurangers in each of the game's five stages. The game includes two difficulty settings and a password feature.

The player begins the game as Boi in the first stage, followed by Mei, Dan, Goushi and Geki in subsequent stages. Each Zyuranger begins his or her stage wielding the standard Ranger Gun, which can be replaced with the character's corresponding Legendary Weapon by finding the entrance to Barza's room in each stage. Each stage also contain ten scattered coins which will replenish the player's life gauge completely when fully collected, as well display a still of the character's mecha and its specifications. At the end of each stage, the player will confront one of the main villains from the show. The villains faced are Pleprechuan, Tottpatt, Bookback, Grifforzer, and Bandora herself.

Between stages, the player will be challenged to one of three possible minigames by Burai the Dragonranger. These consist of a trivia game where Bandora will ask the player a question related to the TV series, a Pong-style game between DaiZyujin and the Dragon Caesar, and a hot potato-style game between GÅryÅ«zin and Lamy. These minigames are also accessible from the main menu and can be played with a second player.</desc>

Also, traditional baseball stats are not used, rather, each player has a set strength and speed rating, and that's all you need to know. A nice addition is the power meter, which can help your team get ahead if used correctly. If you've played other Kyuukyoku Harikiri games, you know exactly what they're all about, so if you enjoy them, give this one a try too!</desc>

It is the first of the series of baseball games that was informally known as "Harisuta", which saw four games published for the Famicom, and two more for the Super Famicom. The starting entry contains 13 teams, 12 of which are modeled after real Japanese teams, while a 13th team (the I team) consists of a team of women players who represent various idols or models who were popular at the time. The game features a single player mode against the computer, a head-to-head mode for two players, or a home run mode where you compete to see who can hit the most home runs. Before the end of 1988, a version of the same game was released with an updated player roster, under the title Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data.</desc>

		<name>Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.

The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.

Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.

All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.</desc>

		<desc>In 22th century, mankind has left the Earth. A new space epoch began, called the Isis era. Human beings built an oasis in deep space, a space station called LaGrange Point. From there, they could send expeditions to remote planets and to explore the space. You control a young pilot named Jin. One day, when you descend into LaGrange from your space ship, you are attacked by mysterious robotic invaders. Your task is now to travel through space and to find out the cause of the assault. But you don't even suspect you'll soon be involved in a deep mystery that was destined long time ago...

"LaGrange Point" is one of the few old-school console-style RPGs to be set in a science fiction environment and to feature space flights. The combat system requires you to use special points (called BP) in order to perform simple attacks, cast spells, and use various techniques that will cost you your HP. You fight random monsters and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, like in Phantasy Star series.</desc>

		<desc>LayLa is on a mission to rescue her friend Iris from an evil doctor who has kidnapped her. This mission will take LayLa through eight different explorable asteroids.

Gameplay mainly involves controlling LayLa through the cavernous maze-like asteroids shooting at the enemies who get in her way. Also of utmost importance is the collection of password disks that are found in each asteroid (they are needed in order to beat the game). Each asteroid contains several elevators that take LayLa to the different areas of the asteroid she is currently in. At the end of each asteroid is a boss monster that LayLa must defeat in order to leave the asteroid.</desc>

		<path>./Legacy of the Wizard.7z</path>
		<name>Legacy of the Wizard</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

This game was in the final stages before release. At this vital time Kevin Costner's movie was released. Robin Hood, prince of thieves.

		<name>The Legend of Zelda</name>
		<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective and is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

		<name>Legendary Wings</name>
		<desc>Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology. A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.

The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and 1943. Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies. Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).

Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode. All of them are side-scrolling. The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses. The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.</desc>

There is an exhibition mode which is just a single game and a tournament mode where you pick your players and then the computer pits you against the others in random made teams; win and you advance on to the next game. 

Pitching is done by a behind the batter view. The pitchers can throw the ball with three different speeds; slow, medium, and fast. Also, the fielders are controlled manually.

You can also choose between an old classic style stadium or a new modern style one. Besides the actual look of the place the only real difference between the two is that it's easier to hit a homerun in the old style stadium.</desc>

		<desc>In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>The game itself is not only based on The Lion King full-length movie, but also on an animated series spinoff, The Lion King's Timon &amp; Pumbaa. The game is most known for its ridiculously abysmal controls and unbelievably bad physics.
Before starting the game, the player is forced to choose one of three playable characters: Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. Simba is balanced overall, but has no projectiles and can only swim for a limited amount of time (however, there's only one water section in the entire game, which is not required to beat to complete the game). Timon has the slowest speed, but he can swim without an oxygen limit and uses tomatoes as his weapon. Pumbaa is heavy to control and can't hold on the cliffs, but has the fastest speed which can be used to ram the enemies.</desc>

To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running.

When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right. On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts</desc>

Ariel has already met Eric, and they plan to wed, but the sea-witch Ursala has taken control of the ocean!  So Ariel (After explaining what's going on to Eric) becomes a mermaid once more and sets off to rescue the sea.

The game takes place from a side view and Ariel (Swimming most of the time, but hopping around on the land occasionally) can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and can then throw them at each other.  She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.

The treasure she finds in the sand is usually just bonus points, but the treasure you find in chests will increase your bubble's power and range.</desc>

Throughout the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters.
Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess.
Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts.
Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong.
K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not.</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<path>./Lone Ranger, The.7z</path>
		<name>The Lone Ranger</name>
		<desc>In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.

The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each 
with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.

Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next..</desc>

		<desc>Lupin Sansei: Pandora no Isan, "Lupin the Third: Legacy of Pandora" is a video game for the Family Computer based on the popular Lupin III series by Monkey Punch and is a sequel of sorts to the film The Castle of Cagliostro. It was developed by TOSE and released by Namco under their Namcot label on November 6, 1987 in Japan only. 

The game is somewhat similar to Namco's earlier released arcade title, Rolling Thunder, with the addition of multiple gadgets and the ability to switch between the three main characters. Lupin and his allies can find other characters in each stage who can be bribed for information. The persistent Zenigata also makes an appearance, present in each stage, attempting to arrest Lupin.</desc>

It also uses the modified Dragon Quest 8 engine, usually exploited by Waixing and Mars Production/Union Bond for creating RPG games.</desc>

		<path>./M.U.L.E..7z</path>
		<name>M.U.L.E.</name>
		<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. 

M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.</desc>

		<name>Mach Rider</name>
		<desc>Mach Rider is a motorcycle combat game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Players, represented by Mach Rider, must make their way across ten sectors to reach the city before it gets taken over by the enemy. Aggressive drivers try to force players off the road; obstacles, such as rocks, and the road's many turns also can cause players to veer off course. If destroyed, Mach Rider will reform himself so that he can continue.

There are three different play modes in Mach Rider.

On the Fighting Course, there are two paths to choose from. The goal must be reached while shooting down enemies or forcing them off the road; more points are rewarded by bumping off enemies. Unlimited lives are available for the first stage, but remaining courses must be finished in three lives or less.

On the Endurance and Solo Courses, there is a certain distance that must be gone before the time runs out. Enemies are on the Endurance Course, but the Solo course is devoid of enemies.

There is also a level editor (similar to the one in Excitebike) that allows creation of Endurance Course tracks, which are erased once the NES is turned off.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, people from Ferikusu could communicate with the gods and divine spirits. The king of the kingdom is now looking for a young man to marry his daughter, the royal princess. Many contestants are selected and a tournament is organized to decide of the new prince. However, before the end or the ceremony, an evil magician sends the last hero, the one the princess has fallen in love with, to an unknown and desolated world. He also quickly realizes that he fell under a terrible curse, and he has been turned into a weird creature. The only item he has left is a magic bracelet the princess gave him. The player takes control of the lost prince and his journey will take him back to where he came from, confront the evil magician and marry the princess he loves. Each stage starts with a short animation (called a "visual stage") which unfolds the story as the game progresses. The rest of the game follows a classic top-view action formula, where the hero defeats all kind of enemies with the help of his magic powers. Sometimes, special items can be found under tree logs or rocks.</desc>

		<name>The Mafat Conspiracy</name>
		<desc>You play as Golgo 13 aka Duke Togo, ace sharpshooter and assassin. Based off a character of various manga comics, Golgo is a down-to-business man at the end of a gun. Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. 

The Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. 

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.</desc>

		<name>Mermaids of Atlantis : The Riddle of the Magic Bubble</name>
		<desc>Mermaids of Atlantis is a censored localization of the formerly pornographic game Bubble Bath Babes (also known as Magic Bubble or Soap Panic) with all nudity removed. Instead of showing erotic images after stages are cleared, this version of the game has cutscenes describing how the greedy emperor O-Dinten sealed the merpeople's games in protective bubbles and forces them pay licensing fees. You must solve puzzles to unlock the games, as an allegory of the real-life situation with Nintendo's lockout chip making it difficult to release unlicensed games for the NES.

The gameplay is reminiscent of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color along the top of the screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica.

The game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.</desc>

		<path>./Magic Carpet 1001.7z</path>
		<name>Magic Carpet 1001</name>
		<desc>Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.
The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.
As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.
Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.
This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Darts contains six different games of darts; 301, 501, 701, Count Up, Round the Clock and Half It. In the 301, 501, and 701 games you can choose the open or double rules. You can choose to be one of 10 characters (a monkey,alien, and a robot are just some of the choices of characters available). Throwing a dart depends on four different factors: position, curve, angle and power. The game allows up to four players to compete against one another.

In the 301, 501, and 701 games the point is to get the score down to exactly zero.
In Count up, the players compete to see who can achieve the highest score.
In Round the Clock, players must try to hit the numbers one  through twelve in sequential order.
In Half It, players begin with 40 points. Players have three chances to hit the assigned numbers to add to their own score. If the player is unable to hit all assigned numbers, their point total will be cut in half. The player with the highest score wins. The assigned numbers are 16, double ring, 17, 18,triple ring, 19, 20 and the bullseye.</desc>

Many of the gameplay elements are the same, with the Force powerup being present here, and the enemies and level designs are similar. The player gets 3 lives and 2 continues. The game itself is somewhat glitchy, with the HUD glitching up whenever the sprite limit is reached.
The graphics and music are based off the original R-Type's, although they're considerably downgraded for this game. As well as this, the font is almost identical to Star Force's. The ending is the ship landing in a base, followed by an "End of game" message.</desc>

Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win.

Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins.

You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Kid Googoo is a Korean unlicensed platform game developed by Zemina in 1992 for the Famicom. From Zemina's history of games they released, this is the only game for the aforementioned console.
In this game, the main character is a kid named Googoo (who seems to be wearing a karate uniform) and its attack ability consists on lifting rocks and throwing them at enemies or pots that contain items such as magic capsules, money (called as "food") or a letter (if the player collects all the letters for EXTRA, an extra life is rewarded). By pausing, Googoo can use special powers or turn into other temporary characters (the latter consumes magic count). "Food" is collected through the levels or by playing the bonus minigames, and it includes an item shop as well, accessible after quitting from a minigame. The game contains 7 worlds, each of them with a boss after a temple level and a password to access directly.

		<desc>Merlwood was once a land of peace and prosperity. The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever? 

Magician is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!</desc>

		<desc>Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC/Amiga/Atari ST strategy game Hacker. As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game. Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot.
The player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim. In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.</desc>

		<desc>An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.</desc>

		<name>Maharaja</name>
		<desc>Maharaja is an adventure game with RPG elements published by Sunsoft and developed by Quest. 

The protagonist is a young man who recovers a mystical treasure box belonging to the Maharaja from the river Ganges. He is rewarded with a feast for recovering the item, but the princess warns him later the same night that the Maharaja's generosity is a ruse and that he is being controlled by an evil wizard and plans to kill the hero in the morning. The hero escapes the palace to look for a way to free the Maharaja and rescue the princess, acquiring the assistance of the gods along the way.

Maharaja features an adventure game interface with a small viewing window for whatever the player character is seeing as well as a list of commands on the side that the player character can try. Speech and other descriptive text appears below the picture window. In addition, the player can also find themselves embroiled in random battles which play out like other turn-based RPGs of the era. The player can find and equip new gear as well as learn new spells as the game continues.

The game was never officially localized into English nor was it ever released outside of Japan. A fan translation was created in 2009, however.</desc>

Irem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.</desc>

		<name>Majaventure - Mahjong Senki</name>
		<desc>This is an NES game that deals with the original version of Mahjong, a game that originated in Asia many centuries ago, but with a unique RPG-style twist. Mahjong is an addictive game that looks a lot like poker, but with tiles. It has its own complexities and being in Japanese doesn't help English-speaking audiences, but, once you learn, you can have an incredibly fun time with this game!</desc>

		<name>Major League Baseball</name>
		<desc>Baseball game featuring full major league rosters of all 26 teams of the 1987 baseball season.  The players, however, are never identified by name, only by jersey number.  Oddly enough, the statistics for the players are very close to, but not exactly, the same as their real-life counterparts.  Close enough that it is possible to identify who each player is supposed to be, though they are represented only by a position (infield/outfield/catcher/pitcher), a number, and a stat line.

There is no season mode, but you can play a regular season game, an All-Star Game (you pick your own All-Stars from the team rosters), or a World Series.

Before each game begins, you set your lineup and starting pitcher from your chosen team's roster.

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for pitching and batting, switching to different views after the ball is hit.</desc>

		<name>Mappy Kids</name>
		<desc>Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.

The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.

After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.

After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.

The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.</desc>

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, people from Ferikusu could communicate with the gods and divine spirits. The king of the kingdom is now looking for a young man to marry his daughter, the royal princess. Many contestants are selected and a tournament is organized to decide of the new prince. However, before the end or the ceremony, an evil magician sends the last hero, the one the princess has fallen in love with, to an unknown and desolated world. He also quickly realizes that he fell under a terrible curse, and he has been turned into a weird creature. The only item he has left is a magic bracelet the princess gave him. The player takes control of the lost prince and his journey will take him back to where he came from, confront the evil magician and marry the princess he loves. Each stage starts with a short animation (called a "visual stage") which unfolds the story as the game progresses. The rest of the game follows a classic top-view action formula, where the hero defeats all kind of enemies with the help of his magic powers. Sometimes, special items can be found under tree logs or rocks.</desc>

		<name>Mario Is Missing!</name>
		<desc>Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. series, is up to no good again in this educational game designed to teach children geography. This time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.

By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).</desc>

		<name>Matsumoto Tooru No Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku - Vol. 1</name>
		<desc>Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku ("Matsumoto Tooru's Stock Success Knowledge") is a stock exchange simulation developed and published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to make 100 million yen (approximately $1.3mil) in the stock market in the span of a single year via a series of shrewd financial decisions and listening to advice about which way a certain type of stock might turn.

The game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin.

Though it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.</desc>

		<name>Mechanized Attack</name>
		<desc>Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.

While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades which are in much shorter supply than the bullets.</desc>

		<desc>In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.</desc>

		<desc>After defeating Dr. Light's six robots that were reprogrammed by the villainous Dr. Wily in Mega Man, it seemed like the world was safe. But it was not to be. Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man! Is the world doomed?

In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world. As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself. Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.
This game introduces the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.</desc>

Mega Man 3 is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots.
It's the first time in a Mega Man that you can slide instead of merely walking and that you get a sidekick. Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it.
Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

Like the other early Rockman / Mega Man games, the Playstation version was only released in Japan, as part of the Complete Works series.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place in India, where a young man's significant-other is kidnapped by an evil wizard. He must then tackle the four areas of the labyrinth temple of Dababa to rescue her.

In order to accomplish this task, the player cannot simple move across the floor. Rather, the player and all of the enemies hop from one square tile to another, throughout the game. In a majority of stages, the player must uncover the seals which will unlock the door to the next stage by leaping on to the particular tiles which keep the seals concealed. Not every door will take the player forward, however, as some doors are trick doors that may take the player to a previous stage. In some stages, the player must simply survive the onslaught of enemies, while in others, the player is racing against the clock.</desc>

		<name>Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu</name>
		<desc>Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu ("Meimon! The Third Baseball Club") is a baseball sim for the Famicom that is based on a manga and anime of the same name about an underdog high school baseball team and the drama that surrounds them. The player can access the game's story mode, which depicts scenes from the manga, by selecting "Dramatic Mode" from the title screen menu. This also adds character portraits to the main game mode. The game itself is a fairly standard NES baseball game. The pitching/batting perspective is from directly behind the batter, and the player moves the entire group of fielders simultaneously whenever the ball is hit. Graphically, the many super-deformed athletes resemble those of Namco's Famista (the series upon which RBI Baseball was based), which was very much the leading baseball franchise at the time.</desc>

		<name>Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan - Kouha 6 Nin Shuu</name>
		<desc>Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan (usually localized as "The West Tako Cheerleaders", but literally translates to "Prestigious School! West Tako Cheerleading Squad") is a Famicom strategy game based on the manga of the same name about a young man who joins his school's intimidating cheerleading squad. In 1987, this same property also saw a live-action movie adaptation.

The game has players moving characters around a city map and fighting rival ouendan teams for dominance. Combat occurs whenever two units meet on the map and cuts to a timing-based mini-game where the player has to input a command before their opponent's fist reaches the current character's profile. The closer the fist gets, the more likely it is that the enemy gets in their attack before the player can. Stronger attacks are listed further down the menu, increasing the risk vs. reward factor as the player scrambles to execute them in time.

After winning a map, the player's party can gain levels and acquire new special attacks, which show up in the attack menu on rare occasions and are very powerful.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Slader Glory is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the protagonist's surrounding via a menu-based commands. The commands the player can choose varies between context, which usually ranges from talking to supporting characters to investigating the surrounding. The player must explore every possible option in order for new choices to appear.

The player can quit at any point of the game and continue later via a password feature.
The game takes place eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, and peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. The main character, a 17-year-old war orphan named Tadashi Himukai, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: "EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.
It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Akûtensô Fixallia</desc>

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

Pachio-kun simply has to lean in to examine the machines closer to ascertain how to make the machine pay out. The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents. Doing so will win the game.</desc>

Each track can be played either in single player mode or in head-to-head 2-player action on a split screen. There are 4 different cars to choose from and manual shifting is a consideration during racing, a facet often overlooked in simpler NES racing game scenarios. While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.</desc>

		<name>Michael English Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Michael English Daibouken (lit: "Michael's English Grand Adventure") is an educational game where the character of Michael, an orange cat, teaches kittens the various letters in the English language as well as some English vocabulary. Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space.

The character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip "What's Michael", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.</desc>

		<desc>One of Mickey's friends is in trouble, and Mickey and Minnie Mouse are on a rescue mission! Mickey Mousecapade is an action platform game. In order to reach your goal (and find out which of Mickey's friends is in trouble), you'll need to jump and climb your way through various levels which take place in different locations (including a fun house, a treacherous sea side, a pirate ship, and a castle). Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).</desc>

		<name>Mickey's Safari in Letterland</name>
		<desc>Mickey's Safari In Letterland chronicles Mickey Mouse's globetrotting adventures (on a slightly modified globe) to capture letters for educational purposes. Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.

This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.

Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.</desc>

More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path.

		<name>Might &amp; Magic : Secret of the Inner Sanctum</name>
		<desc>In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.

This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.</desc>

		<name>Mighty Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.

The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.</desc>

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<desc>Mindseeker is an adventure game from Namco that tests the player's extra sensory perception and latent psychic ability. It features Japanese TV psychic Masuaki Kiyota, who is best known in his native land for a spoon-bending act similar to that of Israeli psychic Uri Geller.
The player can explore the world using two commands: Feel and Exit. Exit will simply move the player character to a new area, while Feel is how the player interacts with the various objects and people in the world; for the purposes of the game, the term "feel" is analogous to "sense". The player is also able to input their own name upon starting the game. As well as the adventure game elements, much of the game involves playing mini-games designed to test the player's psychic ability, such as a card game where the player must guess which symbol will appear next.</desc>

		<desc>Minelvaton Saga: Ragon no Fukkatsu is a Role Playing Game first in the Minelvaton series, being followed by Silva Saga and ending with Silva Saga II: The Legend of Light and Darkness.
Minelvaton Saga takes place on the world Minelvaton, in the area known as Southern Ofelia. In the kingdom of Palmeccia both the King and Queen have been murdered by the hands of a servant of Ragon, son of the Zuhl. The player takes control of the Prince of Palmeccia in a quest for revenge and to kill the evil Ragon.
Fundamentally, the game plays and looks like Dragon Quest. The player is given control of a single character and can explore a number of towns, dungeons, and the world map itself. However, once the player receives the ship for sailing, the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can be reached.
Another unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to exchange blows. The closest analog to this unusual system is the MMORPG, or the MMORPG-ish single player game Final Fantasy XII.
Beyond that, the basic plot and some of the battle system concept seems to have been co-opted by Sega's Sword of Vermilion.</desc>

		<name>Mini-putt</name>
		<desc>Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenge. Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.

To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.</desc>

As you fight your way through each area, you must obtain information and vital ID cards.  Your progress is blocked at every turn by acid flames, raw sewage, scorching steam, high voltage electricity and poison gas.

You can choose from three agents, Max, Grant and Nicholas, according to the situation at hand.  Each is equipped with two types of weapons which can be interchanged according to the surroundings.

If an agent's life gauge runs out the next agent in line will take his place.  If you complete an area successfully then the knocked-out agents will rejoin the team at the beginning of the next area.

The game is made up of six areas with the first and last consisting of two stages.  Two of the areas auto-scroll with all three agents in play at once.

This game will self destruct in five seconds.</desc>

By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

WOO! For every match you tie, Emi puts back on an article of clothing. WHAT?! Yeah, it's a pirate game, no one said it had to be fair.

What's even more unfair is, once you get Emi down to like, four articles of clothing, you have to win three times against various barnyard animals. Win three times against a barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. Win three MORE times against another barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. So yeah, the match is pretty easily stacked in her favor, wouldn't you say?

Before being able to qualify to compete at the Olympics, players must travel the globe and defeat several different opponents. When the player finally makes it to the Olympics, the player will have to face nine different opponents, each the best representative of their home country. If the player performs well enough at the Olympics, they can go back home with either a bronze, silver, or even a gold medal.
When fighting in the Judo matches, the goal is to throw your opponent to the ground for a takedown. When in a fight, there are meters that the player has to be aware of. They are the power meter which measures the fighters current strength and the chance meter which measures the likelihood the player will be able to throw down their opponent. After each match, the player can choose whether to build up their character's strength, technique, or stamina.</desc>

This is a traditional Japanese RPG. You move Momotarou over the world map, visiting towns and dungeons. Defeated monsters bring experience points and raise Momotarou's level. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based and is viewed from first person perspective.</desc>

		<name>Momotarou Densetsu Gaiden</name>
		<desc>The game is based on famous Japanese folk tales. Momotarou is a boy who was found in a huge peach (hence his name, "peach guy"). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or "poverty god", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them.

Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.</desc>

		<desc>The Money Game, released by Sofel for the Famicom in 1988, simulates stock market trading and financial growth. Players start with 1,000,000 yen and must invest wisely to upgrade their living conditions, from a small apartment to a mansion with a pool. The game features a virtual newspaper, telephone, and computer, requiring Japanese literacy. Managing interest rates, currency exchange, and personal relationships—like buying a car and dating—affects gameplay. Success leads to marriage and children, while failure results in a "game over" for poor investment decisions. It inspired a sequel, Wall Street Kid, but no other standalone stock market games followed.</desc>

		<desc>The evil Warlock wants to take over the world! He calls his fellow monsters to join him, but several refuse - and after casting a shrinking spell that backfires and shrinks down all the monsters around him, transporting them to different homes in Los Angeles.

Warlock didn't let his size impairment get in the way of world domination, however, so it's up to The Vampire and The Monster to stop him! Along the way, both characters will have to fight through Warlock's henchmonsters through the streets, sewers, a construction area and even a Japanese garden.

The game features classic platforming action. The player only has one all-purpose attack and they can also double jump to avoid enemies or reach high ledges. The player can also pick up small objects and use them to attack several enemies at once. If there's only one player, they can choose between The Vampire or The Monster. Or if they don't want to go alone, a friend can join in and help them beat Warlock in the two player co-op mode.

The game is based on the Monster In My Pocket toy franchise. The package also included a limited edition Monster in My Pocket toy, Blemmyea (#81), which was only available with this game.</desc>

		<desc>Take the wheel of a monster truck through nine different events at a time or choose the rally and go through all of them. The nine events are hill climb, drag race, bog, car crush, tug-o-war, sled pull, draw bridge, donuts and the combo course.

In the hill climb, players race on a track comprised mainly of steep hills. The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,

Players can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.</desc>

The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball.

		<desc>Thousands of years before the setting of the first game, Shinnok, one of the Elder Gods who control the six realms in the Mortal Kombat universe, attempted to become the conqueror of them all. The thunder god Raiden fought and defeated Shinnok in a war that spanned hundreds of years, sending him to the Netherrealm, where he would be trapped forever. Now, Shinnok has managed to escape from the Netherrealm with help from the sorcerer Quan Chi, and seeks vengeance against the Elder Gods who banished him. In his plan, he first conquers the realm of Edenia, with the aid of a traitor, Tanya, while he prepares to attack the Elder Gods. In order to stop Shinnok's menace, Raiden requests help from the Earthrealm warriors who saved the realms from Emperor Shao Kahn in previous titles.</desc>

Gameplay consists of driving your squad car around the city, pulling over speeders, by flashing the siren, and stopping random robberies, by shooting the getaway car.  Larger crimes will pop up, which lead to capturing whoever the current Public Enemy No. 1 is.  The game ends when you fail in a mission, or when you total your police cruiser.</desc>

		<name>Mottomo Abunai Deka</name>
		<desc>Mottomo Abunai Deka is an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is based on a Japanese TV drama show.

The game is a 2D 1-2 player side scroller. You the player control Taka or Yuuji, or both of these characters at the same time. You'll find yourself up against many enemies of the Yakuza gang, ?The Silver Stars?, and then later on leading you to corruption within the police department and to the main villain at the end. While playing the game you'll also run into three mini-games, which are a shooting gallery, a fast paced car ride and a shootout with one of the boss enemies.

While playing the side scrolling part of this game, if you want to switch weapons, press start and then A to cycle through the selection.

The original name of the game is Mottomo Abunai Deka, which has been retitled as The Most Dangerous Detectives.

All of the text has been translated to the best of my knowledge. The main issue with the text is that there is a scrolling issue that has been worked out as best as possible for now.</desc>

The player controls a party of heroes with an entire army under their control, and fights other armies and random encounters with monsters. To begin the game, the player must purchase and equip their army before setting out.
The game's battles play out in turn-based formations, and each formation acts separately and can target different formations on the enemy's side. For instance, the archers can aim for any of the four rows of enemy forces, though front-line melee fighters are far more limited.</desc>

		<desc>As a baby, Madara was found floating in a river near Mount Shumi. The elder Tatara saved him, build gadgets to replace his missing body parts and raised him together with his grandchild Kirin. On Madara's 15th birthday, when most of the world had already fallen to the Moki controlled by the Emperor Miroku, Madara sets out to find his real body and save the world from the Moki.

Mouryou Senki Madara is an RPG in which players control a party consisting of up two four characters exploring towns, dungeons and a world map from a top-down perspective. Battles occur randomly and the characters move and fight autonomously, although it is possible to pause battles at any time and order characters to fight, defend, use magic or items or flee. Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. 

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</desc>

		<desc>Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold is a graphical text adventure game developed by Toei Animation for the Famicom Disk System, and published in Japan in 1988. The game is based on an anime OVA "Tooyama Sakura Uchuu Chou - Yatsu no Na wa Gold" (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Tooyama Kagemoto. Mr. Gold is a sci-fi adventure about a hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually contributed to fictional adaptations of the Tooyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme.The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.</desc>

		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

He is the son of the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and a skilled fighter himself. One day he hears of a rumor that the evil wizard Kojiro, his father's archenemy, has apparently reared up his ugly head once again! Kojiro's demons invade the land, and threaten death and destruction. "I shall defeat Kojiro!" - says Musashi, - "and maybe even get laid"...

Musashi no Boken can be described as Dragon Warrior set in feudal Japan, as apart from the distinct classical Japanese flavor demonstrated here, the games are very similar. Musashi travels over the world map, visits towns, buys weapons and armor, descends into dungeons, and fights enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective.</desc>

		<path>./Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu.7z</path>
		<name>Musashi No Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu</name>
		<desc>Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu (lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the Middle of Training") is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.
The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.
There are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.
On two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.</desc>

		<desc>My Life My Love: Boku no Yume Watashi no Negai (or "My Life My Love: My Dreams My Desires") is a board style game for the Famicom. This is a board game for one player (no human or computer opponents). You start as an angel in heaven. Your number is drawn at random, which means that you are the next angel to be delivered to Earth to become a human being. You start as a child and live your whole life (dying at 100). Throughout the game, you will do your best to improve your statistics in six categories: knowledge, health, friendship, love, popularity and wealth. You will be ranked among the Japanese population to see how well you are doing in six categories. Japan has a population of 130 million. You will then start at #130,000,000 and try to get to #1. The entire course is very long. You can expect to play it for about 50 hours, and that's as long as you win on the first try. You will not do this on your own. Reaching #1 in the ranking is not easy.</desc>

		<name>Nagagutsu O Haita Neko - Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Issh 80 Nichi Dai Boken (lit. "Puss in Boots: An Adventure Around the World in 80 Days") is a video game based on the third film of The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots that was released exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer. Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure.
Pero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery.
Loosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean, Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features "death water," a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance.
This game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.</desc>

		<name>Idol Hotline - Nakayama Miho No Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

		<name>Namida No Soukoban Special</name>
		<desc>Namida no Soukoban Special (which roughly translates into Warehouse Keeper's Tears Special) is a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 by ASCII Entertainment. By 1986, many of Japan's game players were familiar with Soukoban in one form or another since its introduction in 1982. Rather than publish yet another version of the same old game, ASCII attempted to enhance the Soukoban experience for its debut on the Famicom by providing players with a unique set of tools that let players "cheat" in some fashion in comparison to the original rules. Objects like Magnets and Pulleys provided players with a limited ability to pull boxes, something which the original versions of the game prohibited. Objects such as these, or pepper, or oil, were discovered by pushing certain boxes that hid the items underneath. Progress through the game could be saved to the disk to prevent forcing players to solve puzzles that had already been solved.</desc>

There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<name>Nankin No Adventure</name>
		<desc>Nankin no Adventure is a Famicom Disk System adventure game from SunSoft that plays much like every other Famicom adventure game of the era. The player selects commands from a menu in order to talk to NPCs and solve puzzles which will eventually allow them to progress. As with many of these Famicom text adventures there is a linear critical path that the player must follow in order to move to new areas and reach the next point of the story.
Nankin refers to a semi-obscure manga artist of the same name who was behind much of the art design of the game. Though the game doesn't include any of his pre-existing licenses, his distinctive art style is present throughout. This approach might be equated to Akira Toriyama's artistic involvement with the Dragon Quest and Chrono games</desc>

		<name>Nantettatte!! Baseball</name>
		<desc>In Nantettatte!! Baseball you control one of 16 cartoon-styled teams and try to lead them on to victory. The gameplay is simple and similar to many other baseball games released on the NES, with five ways to play. You can play a versus mode against either the computer or a partner, take a team through a season of between 30 and 130 games in hopes of winning the pennant, play a multiplayer tournament, or play a home run derby and try to knock as many balls as you can out of the park. There's also an edit mode where you can configure your team for the Pennant Mode, and a "Watch" mode where you can watch a CPU-controlled match.

Each of the sixteen teams, just like actual baseball teams, have strengths and weaknesses. Seven of the teams also have designated hitters, who replace pitchers when it's their turn at bat. All teams also have eight starters, who can be switched out at any point (but cannot be switched back). The teams can play in either one of four stadiums, which all are basically the same.</desc>

		<name>Napoleon Senki</name>
		<desc>Napoleon Senki  is a real-time tactics strategy video game developed by Lenar and published by Irem in March 1988 for the Family Computer. In August that same year, BrÃ¸derbund announced that it would be released for the North American NES console as The Battlefields of Napoleon; which was eventually cancelled.

This video game allows the player to re-enact the Napoleonic Wars using a bird's-eye view. Starting with earliest battles against the Holy Roman Empire to grab territory for the fledging French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars in the year 1796, Napoleon would guide the French Revolutionary Wars until they ended in 1802. All the nations that were a participant in the Napoleonic Wars were included like Czarist Russia, Great Britain, and the Spanish Empire. Napoleon's first in-game battle would located in present-day Italy; making the battle equally important in Italian history as it was in French history. There are also battles in what would now considered to be the Arab Republic of Egypt against the Ottoman Empire along with various other conquests in Europe.</desc>

		<name>NARC</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

		<name>Nazo No Kabe - Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<name>Nazoler Land - Soukan Gou</name>
		<desc>Nazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.

Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:
Rotation Maze

A maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.
Nazoler Fortune-Telling

Despite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).
Super Jigsaw

In this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.
Save Princess Momoko!

Promoted as the "major feature", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.
Japan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz

A quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.
Famicom Reaction Test

In this simple "game", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.
Extrusion Puzzle

Similar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.
3D Maze

A simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.</desc>

		<name>Nazo No Murasamejou</name>
		<desc>In feudal Japan, an evil alien descends upon Murasame castle and takes over a giant statue, which then continues to spread its influence over four neighbouring castles. The samurai apprentice Takamaru is thus summoned to recapture the castles and then take on the alien itself.

Nazo no Murasamejou is a fast-paced action game that has some similarities with The Legend of Zelda, although it is faster and has none of the RPG/Adventure elements. It is also much more linear: You fight through the castles one after the other, with each stage consisting of the path to the castle and the castle itself, where the boss is waiting.

Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.</desc>

		<desc>Its another day at school in Nekketsu High and series star Kunio finds a note in his locker challenging him to a secret martial arts tournament. Sure enough Kunio and his friend Riki accept the challenge and head out with the hopes of becoming the grand champions of the city.

Kakuto Densetsu is another 2d side scrolling beat'em up in Nekketsu High series, featuring the same gameplay which involves beating up your enemies in side scrolling levels with a combination of punches, kicks and special moves. The differences in this title however, are that the entire game is laid out as 2-on-2 tournament fights in non-scrolling arenas in which your team must come up on the winning end and advance to the next round. You can play with good old Kunio or create your own character and advance his stats as he goes along in standard Nekketsu High fashion, and you can play alone with an AI-controlled partner or with a friend (you can also go for a 4-player battle royale in the Vs mode). 

Backgrounds have a major role in the fights, with several hazard zones and unique features, and the game also encourages teamwork as many special moves can be unlocked only by combining both of your characters (depending on their compatibility)</desc>

		<name>Nekketsu Street Basket - Ganbare Dunk Heroes</name>
		<desc>Another action/sports title in the Nekketsu High game series. Nekketsu Street Basket is exactly what it sounds like: a tournament of two-on-two "street" basketball matches all across the US featuring the characters of the Nekketsu High series.

The game uses the same base engine and graphics as the other games in the series, featuring super-deformed sprites moving across a side-scrolling stage trying to defeat the opposing team. You can pass the ball, shoot it, and attempt super dunks for added points. As with other Nekketsu games you can choose to play foul and beat the hell out of your opponents with your bare hands or any weapon you can find in the stages, and there are many other rule-bending features such as double and triple hoops that score extra points.</desc>

		<name>NES Open Tournament Golf</name>
		<desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

		<name>NES Play Action Football</name>
		<desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football.  While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

		<desc>NES Virus Cleaner is pretty much a spoof of the NES Cleaning Kit. That thing barely helped clean the NES, just as NES Virus Cleaner doesn't do much for removing ?viruses? from your NES. You guide Clik, the hero, around inside your NES and grab viruses in the various spots they are placed. The ultimate goal is to get to the lockout chip and destroy Virii, the main virus. The obstacles in the game are electric bolts, electric sparks, disappearing blocks, a homing missile system, and of course, time. If you run out of time on a certain level, the game is over. If you get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the point where you picked up the last virus. It's a pretty simple concept overall. I tried to cover everything in the tutorial, but I did in fact miss the part about respawning at the last picked up virus. Oh well, things happen!</desc>

The element of searching for the "almighty stone" in the story does not actually exist in the game. It is a game consisting only of pure tactical and strategic elements, with the goal of ultimately defeating all three factions other than one's own.

This work has a very unique operation system, and the movement method is radio-controlled, similar to ``Bangering Bay'' (1984).</desc>

		<desc>New Ghostbusters II follows loosely the original Ivan Reitman's film plot. You start out by selecting two ghostbusters out of  five (The 5th one is Louis Tully). The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't. 

The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie. For example, in the first courthouse level you fight against the Scoleri brothers. 

The game contains six levels, inspired by the movie:The Courthouse
2. Subways
3. Apartment
4. The Underground
5. The Museum of Art

The player is in control of the action from a side-scrolling perspective. The camera also zooms in for closeups on receiving plays. However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.</desc>

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

		<path>./Nightmare on Elm Street, A.7z</path>
		<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street</name>
		<desc>LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).

Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.

Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.

Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.</desc>

		<name>Niji No Silkroad</name>
		<desc>The game is set in the Middle Ages, all around the famous silkroad, that connected China and the Middle East. In the fictional kingdom Littleland, the evil Zrool conspired against the royal family. He killed the king and the queen and usurped the throne, initiating a dark era of tyranny. But one of the king's guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.

The game is a console-style RPG with first-person perspective, turn-based combat, and some interesting gameplay elements. You get neither experience points nor money from random enemies. Instead, by fighting a lot your popularity increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the game. You become stronger by buying and equipping better weapons and armor. Also, there is a thirst factor in the game. You have to drink water regularly, or else you'll be dried to death.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Crusaders</name>
		<desc>In Ninja Crusaders, a force of alien invaders has descended upon the earth and has wiped out humanity for the most part. Some ninjas survived the onslaught, however, and 2 ninjas in particular named Blade and Talon are assigned to rid the earth of this alien menace.

Ninja Crusaders is a side-scrolling action game that can be played alone or with 2 players fighting side by side. A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff. Battle your way past vistas of a post-apocalyptic world but try not to get hit because one enemy strike will take care of your ninja.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom</name>
		<desc>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.</desc>

		<path>./Ninja Jajamaru - Ginga Daisakusen.7z</path>
		<name>Squashed</name>
		<desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Jajamaru-kun</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:

1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Kid</name>
		<desc>Ninja Kid is a side-scrolling action game in which the eponymous kid must jump and shoot his way through a series of different levels in order to complete his quest. The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.

The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.

In Japan, this game was known as Gegege no Kitaro: Yokaidaimakyo, based on an animated TV series.</desc>

The first game played is a version of Super Mario Bros. in which the player is given 99 lives and the goal of collecting 50 coins in the first level. Upon collecting the 50th coin, the "finished the castle" music will play and a score will be displayed.

The second game played is Course 1 of Rad Racer, using the 328 Twin Turbo vehicle. The player must finish the course as quickly as possible. No clock is shown in the game but the cartridge keeps track internally. After finishing Rad Racer, its score is displayed, multiplied by 10 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. score.

Last up is Nintendo's Tetris in A-type mode. All remaining time for the Championship is played out here. The player's objective is simply to get the best score. The Tetris score is multiplied by 25 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. and Rad Racer scores.

After all the time runs out, a screen will display "Time!" and display the final score, a sum of the previous scores and their multipliers.</desc>

		<name>Nintendo World Cup</name>
		<desc>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>

A body is found on a Blue Train - the name given to Japanese cross-country sleeper trains, i.e. those built to accommodate sleeping passengers - and the player character is brought in to solve the mystery.

Like other similar franchises, the game challenges players to solve the mystery by talking to witnesses and suspects and interacting with the environment to uncover the identity of the murderer.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition II</name>
		<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on a popular animé series for children. The hero Anpanman is the son of the baker Jam-ojisan. His head is made entirely out of bread and bean jam. He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman ("Germ Man") and his minions.

This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:

1. Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.

2. Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the animé's characters.

3. Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.

4. Figure out the differences between similar pictures.

5. Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike  Minesweeper).</desc>

He meets with a trio of gourmands visiting his publication, one of whom extols the culinary merits of foie gras. Shiro is dismissive due to its ugly appearance (never mind the animal cruelty), causing a heated argument between the two. Filled with rage, Shiro heads back to his desk to try and come up with a dish that will blow foie gras out of the water.

It is here that the game begins in earnest, and the most familiar hallmark of the ADV genre begins to rear its head: busywork. The player needs to look at and interact with everything they possibly can if they want to make any progress, often multiple times. The lengths of which the game goes to to pad itself out is often ridiculous, such as when Shiro is only able to visit his own workplace cafeteria after reading a sign that informs him that it exists.</desc>

		<name>Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi - Matenrou No Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>Based upon a Japanese television series that aired in 1987. It features a group of five detective kids on a mission to retrieve various objects stolen by a mysterious thief who wears a golden mask. The group counts the leader Hiroshi, the cute and Aikido expert Yasuko who also happen to be the only girl of the group, Susumu, Satoru and Takeo. The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.
Before getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.</desc>

		<path>./Onyanko Town.7z</path>
		<name>Onyanko Town</name>
		<desc>Players must play the role of a mother cat called Milky who lives in a dangerous metropolis full of dogs. The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.

Unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be "average" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of "dog catches cat; cat catches fish" - emulating the food chain.</desc>

It is a "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

To defeat Krohn, you must get past 30 different chambers blocking the path. On the left and right side of each chamber are force fields which you must maneuver to keep the Millennium orb within the chamber. Each chamber contains a plane in the center with various targets, around which the Orb will travel. You can make the Orb dive out of it's orbital path into the plane and hit the targets. To complete each chamber you need to complete a goal with the targets (often you will need to figure out a way to clear them all.) The Millenium Orb has a limited amount of feul, however, which will be used up over time and in even greater quantities should you miss the Orb with the force fields. When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. 

Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>The game consists of two boards. A small one inside the box, and a larger fold-out one. Players can choose between two game variants, each using one of the boards. For both variants, two to four people can play.

In the game variant that uses the large board, the objective for all players is to build a 'Iyami' from six parts. For each turn, the spinner inside the box is used to determine the number of steps to advance on the board, and the numbers printed on the board determine which body part of Iyami a player can pick. The first person to finish building Iyami wins the game.</desc>

		<name>Outlanders</name>
		<desc>Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.

They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!

Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</desc>

The ship's weapons can be fired in tow directions and defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that equip the ship with different weapons and up to two options. There are three different weapons in addition to the standard shot: Laser, homing missiles and bombs.

The "Edit Mode" presents an unusual feature. In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.</desc>

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. 

As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.

To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.

The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.

Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.</desc>

In P.O.W., the player is a soldier who has been imprisoned in a Prisoner of War camp and must escape. In order to accomplish this, he must defeat a variety of enemies.  The foes will attack you hand-to-hand, with knives, guns, and from helicopters. Boss enemies will guard the end of each level.

To fight back, you can use hand-to-hand, and pick up weapon power-ups, found on the ground, in rooms, or dropped by enemies. These weapons include a knife, which can be used to stab or be thrown, guns and grenades.</desc>

There's a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there's a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can't fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What's cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into and sometimes at the end of these rooms you can earn neat stuff, like new weapons or weapon upgrades.</desc>

		<name>Pachicom</name>
		<desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.
The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.
The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.</desc>

Metal balls would either of or fall in between the holes created by the pegs in order to traverse the board. Certain compartments are added to the board. Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Palamedes 2 - Star Twinkles</name>
		<desc>Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.

Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. 

Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.</desc>

		<name>Panic Restaurant</name>
		<desc>Panic Restaurant is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as chef Cookie. The rival chef Ohdove has taken over his restaurant and it's up to Cookie to reclaim it.

It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

		<desc>Having been sucked into and stranded in an alternate universe, you and your girlfriend must work your way around the puzzles of a magnificent castle to make your way back home.

The castle itself consists of a total of twenty worlds consisting of five stages apiece, each of which is filled to the brim with enemies. From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).

This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.</desc>

		<desc>Patlabor - The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant. In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.

Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.

The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</desc>

		<name>Peepar Time</name>
		<desc>Peepar Time is similar to the Game Boy game Blodia. You control some weird hopping machine that runs across tiles that are 4-, 3- or 2-way. If he falls off a tile into the water, he loses. If he hits a dead end, he bounces back. If he runs into an enemy, he loses. Your guy has a can of oil that lasts for going over 60 squares. You can recharge that with oil and find gold for points. The ultimate goal is to find a key and get to the tent at the end of the level.</desc>

		<name>Perfect Bowling</name>
		<desc>Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

Like Sunman, it never saw the light of day neither in the land of the rising sun nor the home of the brave. Nor even in places in between, as was the case with several other Sunsoft titles of the time. Unlike Sunman, however, Pescatore was briefly revealed to the public in spring of 1991 at Nintendo's Shoshinkai Show. The gameplay in Pescatore borrows the gameplay from PuyoPuyo and changes the rules slightly to require less skill and more luck.</desc>

With his trusty hammer, Kernel needs to clear the levels by slamming all loose bugs. You will be haunted by spiders, ants, fireflies, worms, sharks, jellyfish and mutants.

The nine levels are pretty straightforward side-scrolling platform stages, with a nice twist in level 5, 7 and 8.1 (a helicopter, underwater and moon surface level respectively). While playing, you can view a status report with the remaining bugs to be found. Some defeated enemies leave behind hearts (extra lives) and the final level introduces an adventure element when you have to find a key card to open the door to Ronnie's lair.</desc>

		<path>./Pictionary.7z</path>
		<name>Pictionary : The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.

This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. 

In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.

The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.

Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.</desc>

		<desc>A totally radical game entrenched in a deep underground maze of never-ending pipes. Here is your big chance to try out those plumbing skills. The water is on, think ahead, and most of all, keep on your toes. Nasty accidents do happen! The general idea is to keep the water flow happening by adding the most appropriate piece of pipe. Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath. Don't relax for too long or the only breath you'll be catching is underwater. The minute you thought you were done with this floor, here comes the next floor, just a little faster. Watch out... a totally addictive game!</desc>

		<path>./Pipe Dream.7z</path>
		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.</desc>

		<desc>A pizza delivery guy is in love with a girl named Betty. He's going about his careless job, delivering in hopes of big tips, when something catches his eye. It's a beautiful diamond ring, and it's impossible to resist! Unfortunately, it costs $10,000 - way beyond his budget. And to make matters worse, another man named Nick has eyes for Betty. Now our hero will have to work extra, EXTRA hard to buy it and impress Betty!

In Pizza Pop!, the player fights through seven crazy neighborhoods populated by a whole host of pizza-hungry characters. The player can, however, defeat his enemies by jumping on them, or whacking them with his pizza pan. The player can also run through the level or use motor vehicles to get around, but he can't run for too long or else he'll get tired - unless he jumps while running. In addition, there are two pizza-stacking mini-games which can earn the player points and extra lives.</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<name>Pocket Monster</name>
		<desc>Pocket Monster is a pirated platformer unrelated to the Mega Drive/SNES pirate, aside from being a platformer based off the Pokémon franchise. Unlike a standard NES game, the B button jumps instead of A, which in this game is used to run and do an electric shock, which clears any enemy on the screen. The player can also jump on the enemies like in Super Mario Bros. Pikachu can take three hits before losing a life, with the amount of hits left represented by a Pokéball counter on the top right corner of the screen. There are a total of four worlds (Velbt, Woods, Tableland and Motte) which are split into three levels each, as well as a single-screen boss battle at the end of each. The background graphics are mostly ripped and slightly modified from Athena and Adventure Island II. Some of the enemies are also taken from various games, with some of them based off Pokémon. The music is seemingly original despite having the sound engine ripped from Konami games while the sound effects are taken directly from those games. The ending is Pikachu dancing with an "End" message at the top of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Pocket Zaurus: Ju Ouken no Nazo (possibly translated as "Pocket Zaurus: Mystery of Ten Kings Swords", the Ten Kings are the ten judges of hell who review the conduct of the recently deceased) is an action game developed by Bandai and published in February 1987. At the time of this game's release, Bandai produced a line of dinosaur pens, stationary, and similarly theme school supplied under the label Pocket Zaurus. As such, the game itself has a slight educational aspect to it.
The game is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control Hashimoto-Zaurus, named after Hashimoto, an employee of Bandai who presumably invented the concept of Pocket Zaurus. Despite sharing the name with the product line, characters which resemble those used in the product are hardly ever seen, and the enemies are not at all related either. The idea for the game was submitted by a reader of the game magazine "Family computer Magazine," which was published by Tokuma Shoten.</desc>

Instead of being a simple compilation of card games like the previous two Poker games this game is actually a board game featuring various card games called King of Casino (said games can still be selected individually at the main menu however.) The story in this mode is about a guy named Jack who is invited to Las Vegas by its mayor to become a millionaire. The player travels the playing board by rolling a die which determines what game they can choose to play or come across one of several characters. The games that can be played are King Poker (standard poker), Poker (Texas Hold 'Em), Blackjack, and 13 Cards. After reaching a particular financial milestone (every $200,000) the game will play a cinematic of a man clapping in front of a city then posing to show one of several flying objects. They are in order a UFO, a witch, a helicopter, and a blimp with the word "KING" on it. When you become a millionaire the game will automatically cut to the ending which features credits.</desc>

		<name>Popeye No Eigo Asobi</name>
		<desc>Popeye no Eigo Asobi (Popeye's English Game) is the Japanese-exclusive spin-off to the Popeye arcade game.
The game includes three modes: Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.[3] In Word Puzzle A (based on the first level of the original game), the player is given the Japanese term for a word in one of six categories: Animal, Country, Food, Sports, Science, and Others (due to technical limitations, these terms are displayed entirely as katakana, regardless of their origin).[3] Blank squares for the English word are given, and the player must maneuver Popeye around to point to letters of the alphabet in order to fill in the blanks. Each wrong letter entry prompts Brutus/Bluto to punch a basket carrying Swee'Pea; the player must solve the puzzle before Swee'Pea's basket is knocked off the platform it is attached to.
The player may also forfeit the puzzle by punching the "?" icon. If the puzzle is lost or forfeited, the correct English word will be displayed. Word Puzzle B is identical to the "A" mode; however, the player is not given the Japanese term beforehand. In the two-player Word Catcher mode (based on the third level of the original game), the first player controls Popeye and the second controls Bluto. Three Japanese words are displayed on the screen's left side, and both players compete to collect letters thrown by Olive Oyl to spell out their English equivalents. A player wins when he or she has correctly spelled five words.</desc>

Originally published for the PC-6001 system in 1983, the NES port allows players to input commands by selecting them via their gamepad from a verb list and search onscreen graphics for hot spots.

The story puts players in the shoes of a nameless Japanese police detective on a quest to solve the murder of a bank director. On his travels through real Japanese settings, the nameless, silent protagonist is assisted by his colleague Yasu who carries out his orders.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 2191, and Earth's blissful existence was governed by a master computer. Then suddenly, its master control program malfunctioned, and people panicked ensuring total chaos. Secret Agent Nova is called in to gain access to 6 security rooms, access the control center and destroy the computer in order to restore our society.

Power Blade is a platform game, in which you must run through the level, destroying various enemies, and exit through the door. However, you can't leave each sector without locating agents. By destroy enemies, you can get power-ups which restore your energy or upgrade your weapon. Occasionally, you can get a special power-up which transforms you into a Mech, which has a special attack mode and an three units of energy.

You must get through each sector before time runs out. You can leave a sector without getting the ID card and go to another sector, and come back when you're ready.</desc>

		<desc>Christmas Eve, 2200.

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.</desc>

When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".

Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.</desc>

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

Percy is a little persimmon who will be your trusty side-kick throughout your quest and who will help you on many occasions. The puzzles are on the simple side, and are primarily based on talking to characters, finding items and giving them.</desc>

		<desc>Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament is a golf game with fantasy elements thrown in, developed by Bandai and published on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. The game is based on a manga (Japanese comic book) known as Pro Golfer Saru published by Fujiko Fujio (also responsible for Doraemon) about a young cave man or neanderthal-like boy who desires to become the greatest golfer in history. To accomplish this goal, he trains in the most desolate of locations, driving golf balls over giant chasms in an effort to hit greens several hundred meters away.

The game is composed of a training mode as well as the tournament challenge. The first nine holes replicate the desolate, and almost prehistoric locations that Saru normally trains in. Balls must be driven over wide spaces in order to stay in bounds and continue play. The back nine holes take place is a more modern, and even slightly futuristic locale, where Saru must sink balls from across rooftops. The game will save one players performance to disk. It was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

It adds a few features such as two additional teams (for a total of 12) and updates the official team rosters, but nothing changed in regards of gameplay, graphics or music. This is historically relevant as it would become common practice for future sports game franchises worldwide. This game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. Although the original R.B.I. Baseball was ported from Family Stadium, both franchises diverged after the initial game. The R.B.I. Baseball series went on to favor a more realistic looking athlete sprites while the Family Stadium series continued with the cartoonish 'super deformed' sprites.</desc>

		<name>Pro Yakyuu : Family Stadium '88</name>
		<desc>Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is the third in Namco's Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium series. As with its immediate predecessor, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87, it is a slightly revamped version of the original with updated rosters. As with modern-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Unlike the previous versions there are now four stadiums to choose from. In addition to the size of the stadium, the presence of wind and the turf available in the stadium affect elements of the game. The concept of 'strong players' was also introduced in this version. Two players in the starting line-up are chosen at random to have their stats increased higher than usual. During the seventh inning, the 'Lucky 7' effect occurs, and all players receive enhanced status. The team edit function appears for the first time in this game (edited teams would disappear when the console power was turned off since no battery backup was included). Though this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization, subsequent R.B.I. Baseball games were created in the US and are entirely independent from Namco's Family Stadium series.</desc>

		<desc>Professional Mahjong Gokuu is the third game for the Famicom to be based on Mahjong, the competitive tile game popular in China and Japan. It is a four-person version of the game, which is generally how the game is played in real life, though uncommon in simulations during this era due to the additional computing power needed for three AI opponents.

As a "professional" Mahjong game, there is an opportunity to play a mode where the player can gamble on outcomes beforehand. The amount of cash gained or lost is usually based on the quality of the winning hand, but occasionally the player can also make bets to increase their take should they win (though, of course, any money gambled in this way is lost if someone else wins the hand).</desc>

		<name>Pulsar No Hikari - Space Wars Simulation</name>
		<desc>Pulsar no Hikari ("Pulsar of Light"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.

Exploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.

Accidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game. It's generally considered a bad idea.</desc>

		<name>Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>"Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream" is the reedition of the previous version "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!". Contrary to popular belief, Tyson was not removed because of his rape conviction (which did not occur until a year after the changeover), but because his contract expired. Since he had lost the title to James "Buster" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler.
Due to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that. While Mr. Dream can't use "flooring punches" forever, his punches are quick, his reaction time is top-notch, and he's also a difficult opponent to fight. The pass code to fight him is 007 373 5963.</desc>

		<desc>The NES version of The Punisher is an on-rails shooter tracking behind Frank Castle as he trades fire with the gangs of some of his classic enemies. Aside from being one of the few NES rail shooters, the game features an uncommon amount of destructible items in its levels. You also have the ability to move Frank to the left or right of the screen to dodge incoming fire, or to hold down the fire button to lock him in place and move the aiming cursor.

The game features six "missions" with a number of varying environments and levels within them. Standard pickups of armor and increased firepower are present, as well as grenades which can be launched with the B button. Earning a 100% kill rating (as The Punisher would surely try to do) gives an unlimited "Super Gun" upgrade for the next stage.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>Pyramid is an action puzzle game similar to Tetris. Stones of various shapes and sizes fall from the top of the screen, and you need to move and rotate the stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen. Should the stones reach the top of the screen the game is over. If you get in trouble, there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with. Unlike the square and rectangular shaped pieces found in Tetris, each of the shapes in Pyramid have one or more angles to them making complete lines more difficult to form.</desc>

		<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

		<name>Quattro Arcade</name>
		<desc>Quattro Arcade is an collection of 4 action arcade games, all of which feature single and 2-player modes.

1. C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.

2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.

3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.

4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.

All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in the Tower of Druaga series is actually a prequel to the original game. Right after the demon Druaga stole the Blue Crystal Rod, the goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to retrieve it.

The player controls Ki in her way up the 60 tower's levels. As in the original game, she must find the key to exit each floor of the tower in a limited time. But unlike the original, this game is a platformer, and the player controls an unarmed Ki who must avoid the tower's mosters. To make her way up, she can dash and jump, and she'll keep getting higher as long as the jump button is held. If she hits a ceiling when jumping or a wall when dashing, she'll drop to the ground and be stunned by a moment.

Ki will also find chests with items to help her (like warps to higher levels of the tower or wings that will help her control her "floating), which effects will last only until she leaves the floor where she found them.</desc>

With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.

The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.</desc>

This second version is similar to the original game in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season.

Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>This second Pro-Am racing game for NES introduces some innovations compared to its predecessor. Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</desc>

		<desc>Race America is a 2-car cross-country racing game. Either 2 players can compete on the same screen, or the computer can control the second player. The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

Eight new tracks are featured (with new graphics and music), each with a variety of hills, turns, obstacles, and other cars to get in your way. Crashing into other cars or any obstacles on the side of the road cause you to slow down or come to a stop and lose valuable time.

Successfully isolating an opponent from the rest of the board causes them to forfeit the game. If you manage to isolate every every opponent, Jirai-kun will advance the next level.

		<desc>Sequel to Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands sees Bub and Bob (in 2 player mode), who are now curiously small boys rather than dinosaurs, attempting to rid the Rainbow Islands of bad guys.

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each.

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.</desc>

		<name>Rally Bike</name>
		<desc>There's a cross-country motorcycle rally going from San Fransisco to New York. In Rally Bike, the player has but one goal, to work their way up through the ranks of the racers and place high enough to qualify for the next race. The game contains six stages to race through.

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.

If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).</desc>

		<desc>John Rambo is a Special Forces solder that is currently spending time in military prison, well until Colonel Trautman decides that Rambo is the ideal solder to be sent on a special mission. Rambo’s mission is simple, go to Vietnam and photograph the POW camp there. He is also ordered not to engage the enemy or rescue any POW’s.  In Vietnam, Rambo meets his contact, Co, and she sets up the passage to the POW camp. During the mission Rambo cannot bear just photographing the POW camp when he has an ample opportunity to rescue a POW in the camp. So Rambo, disobeying his orders, tries to rescue a POW, which is when it all starts to go wrong.

Rambo is a side scrolling platform game where the player controls Rambo with his mission to Vietnam. The game starts at the military base before getting sent to Vietnam. In Vietnam, Rambo has to fight animals in the jungles, swamps, and caves like wasps, snakes, fish, tigers, bats, spiders, birds, apes and flamingos. Before making his way to the POW camp he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing different color shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map requiring the player to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen.  There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up that are knife, throwing knife, bow and arrow, bow and exploring arrow, gun, and hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There is also health vile that restores health as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password save that can be retrieved when talking to any person.</desc>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets).

		<desc>In this Famicom version of the arcade hit, you are faced with with 4 different scenarios (of increasing difficulty) and more depth than the original game. 

But the basic elements of Rampart are still there: first you build a castle from Tetris-esque pieces. Next you place a series of cannons and use them to bomb the enemy. Then you repair any damage the enemy inflicted on your fort, and do it all over again. 

When you reach a certain number of points, the scenario is cleared and you can pick another one.</desc>

The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle.

But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins.

Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.</desc>

It features and is named for Japanese TV personality La Salle Ishii and focuses on a beleagured manager (the protagonist, named by the player) and his three-member up-and-coming J-Pop band "Childs". In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must "fight" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.
The game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.</desc>

		<name>MTV's Remote Control</name>
		<desc>Remote Control is based on the MTV quiz show of the same name. During the game three contestants (computer or human controlled) compete by answering questions about various TV shows, movies, characters, or actors/actresses. There are two rounds of gameplay followed by a third "think real fast" round. 

In the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are "video high", "cop shows", "saturday night live", "soap operas", and many more) which will vary from game to game. Sometimes a surprise channel may appear which doesn't have a question, but awards or removes points from a player. These rounds end when all of the supplied questions have been exhausted. Near the end of the second round, the lowest scoring player is eliminated from the game leaving two players for the final round.

The final "think real fast" round lasts for thirty seconds; during this time the players need to answer as many short answer questions as possible to earn points. At the end of this round the player with the most points wins the game.</desc>

In the game, you control Ren &amp; Stimpy through various side scrolling levels which are based on different episodes of the cartoon show.  Episodes the levels are based on are Space Madness,Out West, and Robin Hoek. 

In Space Madness, Space Cadet Stimpy must get a dazed Ren to the sick bay to feed him some chicken soup to cure him of his space madness. You will guide Ren through the Space Diner, the Laboratory, the Button Room and the Zero Gravity Bathroom to get to the sick bay. There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.

Out West pits Three-Fingered Hoek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.

During Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.</desc>

		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at the end of the 21st century. A gigantic snake-like alien called Sonada invades Earth and constructs a base under the soil. Sonada attacks various locations, stealing precious resources, and appears invulnerable to all forms of modern offenses. Engineers regroup and construct a base where a new weapon can be developed. They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.

Replicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.

The conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage. A bonus level is provided for the player after each boss is defeated before they progress to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Risa no Yousei Densetsu (Risa's Fairy Legend) is a text adventure game developed by Konami, and published for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. In the game, you control a protagonist that you name, but the game also stars Risa Tachibana, a popular Japanese singer around the time of the game's release. Together with Risa, your goal is to defeat a witch of darkness by obtaining several key items. Six of Risa's songs are interwoven into the adventure, and the lyrics can provide clues to the proper solution of the game, which is divided into four chapters. At times, a telephone number would appear on the screen, and a telephone service was established for a limited time so that players could call the numbers to get more clues. At times, use of the microphone on the second Famicom controller is required to make progress in the game.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<desc>RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<name>Robo Warrior</name>
		<desc>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.

Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.

Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different "worlds" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</desc>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

The Evils were captured by the God of Heaven and restrained in four towers with four magic Balls. People have now lived peacefully for thousands of years.

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

		<desc>The Rocketeer is based on the 1991 Disney movie of the same name. Nazis are trying to steal an experimental jet pack that will presumably give them a strategic edge in modern warfare for the purpose of world domination. It is up to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the world safe.

The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).</desc>

In this side scrolling game, you must help Rockin' Kat Willy to save his girlfriend through 7 stages. Each stage is a TV show broadcast through different channels of a TV set, and you must thus choose which channel you want to play. Through the channels Willy it will be sent to different themed shows such as western movies, gangster movies, etc, as well as some bonus channels.

Willy can walk and jump around, and carries as a weapon a spring-load Super Punch Gun, which he can put in diverse uses:

1. Knock his enemies: by pressing A.
Perform higher jumps: by jumping (B) and pressing down + A.
Spin Attack: by grabbing a ledge (A) and rotating with the d-pad.
Spin Jump: by grabbing a ledge (A), rotating with the d-pad and jumping (B).
Catch and Trow: by holding A, grabbing an object and releasing A.

He can also buy attachments that will make his gun more powerful, such as the Bomber, the Twin Balls, the Hammer Punch and the Jet Sneakers. 

Rockin' Kats is so cartoonish that you might expect to see it on Saturday morning TV.</desc>

		<name>Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</name>
		<desc>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. 

The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

		<desc>Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US.

While presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

As you rollerblade through the suburbs, city streets, beaches, and parks you can earn points by performing a variety of tricks and jumps. Additional points are earned by completing the course under the time limit. There are also several bonus rounds where you need to navigate through (or jump over) obstacles such as barrels or cones. In order to place in the super rollerblade challenge, you need to complete all of the events and the challenge with 10,000 points for third place, 15,000 for second, or 20,000 for first! If you crash too many times during an event or run out of time, the game will be over. The game allows you to select one of two characters, and features an isometric overhead point of view which scrolls to follow the action.</desc>

It includes a silly story about three different roller skates gangs (somewhat like motor cycle gangs) in a close future, which is most an excuse for the game to exist.

You can choose between three different gangs, one is all-around, one is fast and weak (and consists of women) and one is slow and strong, you get the fashion. This adds some replayability, but in reality, they are kind of the same.

The game also suffers from trial and error; you must learn the courses if you want to master them. Luckily, the game has unlimited continues.</desc>

		<name>Route-16 Turbo</name>
		<desc>Route-16 Turbo is an updated version of an older arcade game entitled Route 16, developed jointly by Tehkan (later Tecmo) and Sunsoft (in a manner similar to the way Namco's Warpman is an updated version of Warp &amp; Warp.) Route-16 Turbo takes the concept established in Route 16, and updates the quality of the graphics, but keeps the goal of the game the same. The game play is a near perfect combination of Rally-X and Venture. The player drives a car through several zoomed in blocks collecting bags of money and other items, and travels between blocks along a zoomed out view of the world.</desc>

		<path>./RPG Jinsei Game.7z</path>
		<name>Rpg Jinsei Game</name>
		<desc>RPG Jinsei Game  is a Japan-only role playing game for the Family Computer that is similar to Jinsei Game, which is the Japanese version of The Game of Life.

The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics in order to unlock the better features of the game.

Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident.

Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats are used instead of hit points and magic points</desc>

		<desc>Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a)rushes in before attacking b)attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c)wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade conversion arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.

There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters</desc>

		<desc>Another game based on the animé series Saint Seiya. The animé (and the game) tells the story of the noble Bronze Saints who have to save the goddess Athena, the only benevolent deity among the rivaling Greek gods. In the game, you control four Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyoga, Dragon Shiryu, and Andromedus Shun. At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event.

The gameplay is split into side-scrolling action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the side-view sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called "Seven Senses", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.</desc>

		<desc>Samurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for the Famicom Disk System in Japan towards the end of 1988. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.

While the game may resemble an RPG at first, it is actually a traditional Famicom adventure game, similar to Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player can select from a set of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</desc>

		<name>San Guo Zhi - Qun Xiong Zheng Ba</name>
		<desc>San Guo Zhi: Qun Xiong Zheng Ba (The Romance of Three Kingdoms: The Fight Of Heroes' Pleiades) is a fighting game in the setting of the Chinese era of Three Kingdoms made by ASDER at an unknown date. This, most likely, has nothing to do with Koei's Three Kingdoms-based 3D fighting game, Dynasty Warriors.

This game doesn't use a 'traditional' Street Fighter II engine, instead, it comes up with a heavily modified engine from Samurai Shodown. Several features that weren't present in any other fighting games on Famicom were included: a 'rage' gauge that may be refilled by holding BW+A and performing a super move when it's fully charged; three-tiered health bar; and, finally, the 'conquest' mode, where you have to eliminate all of your opponent's fortresses in order to win.

The game has six playable characters, with every of them selectable from the beginning (from left to right): Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Cao Ren, Mei Ya [?] and Lu Bu. However, during the 'conquest' mode, there are two more characters that are not playable the regular way: Shi Ren and Xie Seng. Both of them are slightly overpowered but have only two tiers of health at the very beginning.

In the 'arcade' mode, the player should defeat all six opponents (including his clone) in a specified order. Only nine continues are available for this type of game.

'Conquest' mode, in its' turn, proposes the player to choose one of two preset teams, with each having three characters. After the choice is done, the player has to decide which enemy's fortress he should siege. Once the fortress is selected, the attacker's staying on his own, while the defending side has Shi Ren, Xie Seng and the actual "defender" (stage "owner") appearing in the same defined order, King of Fighters style. Should only the attacker defeat one of the opponents, his health's being fully restored. Once all three opponent's fortresses fall, the player wins.</desc>

		<name>Sanada Juu Yuushi</name>
		<desc>It is a Sengoku era themed RPG featuring ninjas. Sanada Yukimura (also known as Sanada Nobushige) is the titular character. He was a Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku period. He was especially known as the leading general on the losing side of the Siege of Osaka. Yukimura was called "A Hero who may appear once in a hundred years" and "Crimson Demon of War". A legend says that Yukimura had ten heroes who took an active role at the battles of Osaka Castle. They were called the Sanada Ten Braves, the group of ninjas who are also referenced by the title.
In the game, Sanada must locate and recruit the ten braves. Upon finding each one, they usually require that Sanada complete a task before they agree to join him. Combat is conducted in turns, using typical menu commands. However, unlike the Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy series, which popularized party-on-party battles, combat in this game is strictly one-on-one. However, the player may select from among any recruited character to do battle, even changing characters between rounds. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor translated from the original Japanese. A remake was developed for mobile phones and published in 2005.</desc>

		<name>San Goku Shi - Chuugen No Hasha</name>
		<desc>Sangokushi refers to a novel written about the Three Kingdoms period of China, where the country was temporarily split into three warring states. This is different to the the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, a mostly fictionalized account written some considerable time after the conflict was over and has had many video game adaptations, not least of which being Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms and their later Dynasty Warriors series.

As a war strategy game, the goal for the player and their chosen side is to reclaim all of China under their rule. Players can gather intel, invade other territories or increase their own stats and purchase weapons and supplies for their armies. The game affords the player a certain number of actions per turn before letting the CPU opponents have their turns.

Though this game was created after Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is in fact the first NES game to be based on the conflict.</desc>

After the end of the game, the player is awarded with a large ostrich trophy.

		<name>Samsara Naga</name>
		<desc>Sansara Naga is set in the fantasy-filled lands of India during the Vedic age and also mixes elements of Japanese folklore such as the legend of Brahman Umibozu ("sea bonze"). Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Rta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage.
The story revolves around a Boy/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF. The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games.
Sansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pokémon and Earthbound.
The Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.</desc>

Like in many Famicom adventure games, the player can gather clues by examining sites of interest, talking to various people and keeping track of the information they've gathered. As the case continues, more people working for the titular game company start dying and the player is given more murders to solve. Time is an important factor in the game as talking to right people and being in the right places at the right moments will prove instrumental towards solving the mystery. The President of the game company only gives the protagonist three days to solve the case before they get the police involved, giving the player a strict deadline. The game's writer will introduce himself just before the player is asked to identify the culprit, and provide the game's final opportunity to save. The game also has multiple endings, depending on what the player does after the murderer has been identified.</desc>

		<name>Sd Battle Oozumou - Heisei Hero Basho</name>
		<desc>SD Battle Oozumo: Heisei Hero Basho (1990) is the first game in Banpresto's Compati Hero series for the Famicom. Initially a sumo game, the series expanded into various crossover titles and even influenced the Super Robot Wars series. The games typically involve SD heroes facing off against a combined greater evil and sometimes refer to the characters as Gachapon figures.

This game features characters from the Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Gundam franchises battling in sumo wrestling matches across different arenas.</desc>

		<desc>SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi 4 is based on the popular SD Gundam series. It's a standard turn-based game where you have to take over the opponent's base to win. You have many types of fighting robots at your disposal to achieve this goal. The interesting part about this game is the level of customization; before each game, you can set options such as how much money each player has, if they start with a small / large number of units on the battlefield, and if the players are human or computer controlled. This game improves upon previous games in the series, as there are now set campaign battles to participate in, as well as the usual matchmaking maps that you can select from.</desc>

		<name>Sd Gundam - Gachapon Senshi 5 - Battle Of Universal Century</name>
		<desc>This is the final installment of the SD Gundam World series to be released on the Famicom. The objective of the game is to conquer both Earth and space, by leading your army into battle against groups of rival armies. There are 10 preset scenarios in the game, each with a specified number of teams and a time limit to get the objectives done. (The player can also choose a Free Scenario.) Once a scenario is chosen, and game settings are set (all settings can be changed in Free Scenario mode), the player and computer take turns navigating units through a series of menus, in the hopes of gaining enough force to occupy a locale. Once a locale is captured, the player who took it over gains money which can be used to bolster their units. The first player to capture all 21 areas (or the player further ahead when time is up) wins the scenario. A battery-backed memory allows players to save their progress and return to the game at a later time.</desc>

This story in this game is completely separate from the other two games. It takes place in the same world, but the characters do not coincide, so you won't see Amuro or Knight Gundam. Instead, you are introduced to the knights of the round table, Gundam style! Although still a turn-based RPG/Dragon Warrior clone, this game has
several dramatic changes from the previous two.</desc>

		<desc>An expansion of sorts for SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars which plays just like the original but includes 5 new maps to play on.

While the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves. This could range from thirty seconds to a several minutes just for one of the three possible commands. Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice. It was, however, possible to trick the computer into trapping itself against obstacles on the right maps.</desc>

		<desc>SD Detective Blader was released in Japan in 1991 and never brought to Western shores, which was a great shame since it's a an imaginative, humorous and challenging RPG set in a future Tokyo. Fortunately, an excellent new fan translation makes the game accessible to a wider audience.
Blader is a space detective and arrives on Earth in the Galaxy spaceship, which remains his base during the game. The battle system is turn-based, the encounter rate in dungeons is very high, and the game moves at a fast pace with allies joining and leaving the party at various intervals. SD Blader is very
much like an early Dragon Quest RPG with nice sub stories involving each town, except that you use guns and science rather than swords and sorcery: and it's
great fun to play.</desc>

It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.
For example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.</desc>

		<name>Seikima 2 - Akuma No Gyakushuu</name>
		<desc>The game is based on a then-popular Japanese heavy metal band formed by Damian Hamada called Seikima-II. This band lasted from its creation in 1982 to its dissolution on December 31, 1999. Their history, as it has been prophesized, is that they are a group of demons preaching a religion in order to propagate Satan through the use of Heavy Metal. Each member is a demon of a different hierarchical class with His Excellency Demon Kogure being leader of demons and His Majesty Damian Hamada being crown prince of hell. In accordance to the prophecy and after completing the world conquest, the band would disband at the end of the century on December 12, 1999 at 23:59:59 Japan Standard Time (09:59:99 Eastern Standard Time).
Players take control of Demon Kogure, a member of the real life Japanese heavy metal band Seikima-II. He is on a mission to rescue his fellow "demon" bandmates who have been captured and imprisoned by the God Zeus.</desc>

		<desc>The boy Michimune and the girl Miu happily live in a small house together with their wise old grandfather. One day, just when they were about to celebrate Miu's birthday, the room suddenly became dark, and an evil demonic figure appeared out of nowhere. Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name Rosenkreuz. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: "Save... Miu...". And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.

"Seirei Gari" is a horror-themed adventure game along the lines of the more known  Uninvited or  Deja Vu. Every action is performed by choosing a command from the menu. You should examine every location before objects become "visible" and possible to interact with. Sometimes you'll also have companions at your side who will help you on your quest.</desc>

It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

The game plays very similar to Shin Megami Tensei (NES) and is one of the few games of this genre to be available on this console.
Originally, Shadow Brain was sold with a VHS tape detailing the story behind the game. The game has a Sci-Fi story behind it, decent graphics and nice music. Shadow Brain seems like a very solid alternative to Shin Megami Tensei.</desc>

		<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<desc>Shatterhand is an action game with 8-direction scrolling. You control Shatterhand in his quest to find and defeat General Grover, leader of the Metal Command. Through the game you'll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhand's primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.

Additional help can be given from any of the 8 hovering satellite robots, each of which has it's own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.

The game has 7 stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order.</desc>

		<desc>In Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijō Yūkai Jiken (Sherlock Holmes: The Kidnapping of the Earl's Daughter), Holmes has to rescue a countess from an evil kidnapper. By travelling all over Great Britain, he can collect the clues and defeat the thugs in order to conduct a thorough investigation.

Parks, sewers and even private houses provide clues needed to solve the mystery and bring the kidnapper to justice. Innocent citizens can also be kicked around just like the criminals. Knives and guns can also be integrated into Holmes' offensive techniques; allowing him to collect money from fallen thugs. If Holmes is killed by any means, the mystery becomes a perfect crime, thus terminating the game.</desc>

		<desc>Shikinjou, or Shikinjoh, is a puzzle game inspired by Mahjong Solitaire and Sokoban. Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City.
		  
		  The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.</desc>

The game is loosely based off the original game, and it shares the same characteristics of other Nanjing RPGs, since they share the same engine. The battle system here isn't implemented properly; the game treats the battle layout as a standard RPG battle but still relies on the gauges from the original active battle system the game uses.The game only goes up to the fight with Magus, whose battle is cited as being near impossible due to requiring near-frame perfect inputs even with maxed stats.</desc>

		<desc>Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.

A curious addition to this version is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.</desc>

		<name>Shin Satomi Hakken-den - Hikari To Yami No Tatakai</name>
		<desc>Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai ("New Eight Dog Chronicles: Battle of Light and Darkness") is a traditional Japanese RPG that follows the story of the 19th century historical novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or Eight Dog Chronicles, based on eight half-brother samurai who were all descended from a dog and team up for various adventures across Sengoku period Japan. In particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.

The game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.</desc>

		<desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

		<desc>The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200.
Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which        extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points.
The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

		<name>Shoukoushi Ceddie</name>
		<desc>Shoukoushi Cedie is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master). The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.</desc>

		<name>Shaffle Fight</name>
		<desc>Shuffle Fight is a strategy game for the NES / Famicom that features characters in robotic costumes from models and anime franchises owned by the Banpresto company. This game is clearly related to the Super Robot Wars (AKA Super Robot Taisen) series, which is a long-running tactical RPG series with the same premise: appearances by many characters from Banpresto franchises, many of which are the same characters featured in this game. Among the most popular characters are those from the Mobile Suit Gundam series, although several other cool-looking franchises are included. The rules of the game are simple. You have character cards, called battle cards, which are used to battle other characters. During the battle, players take turns rolling dice. The higher the dice roll, the more damage you inflict. Players have attack and defense ratings that will increase or decrease damage. You can also use item cards to improve character stats during the battle.</desc>

You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.

There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war. 

How well will you do when matched against history?</desc>

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

Despite everything Sylviana tried, her mother's condition only got worse. Then one day, she heard a rumor about a Dr. Doppler, who can create a medicine that will cure any disease. She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine. However, she soon finds out that the doctor is unable to help her, due to having had his eight treasures stolen from him by demons. Sylviana vows to return the treasures to him in exchange for the medicine.
The game borrows it's combat system from games like Hydlide and Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished, where damage is inflicted upon (and exchanged with) enemies by crashing into them. However, there are no levels or experience points, so Sylviana's power only grows by virtue of the improved equipment that she purchases or finds. Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure. Eventually, the player enters a cave and steps through a mirror to enter the mirror image of the original world map, with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs. the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</desc>

He tells Bart he is the only one who can save Radioactive Man who has been sent to the Limbo Zone, a mysterious prison that revolves around a black hole. Bart turns into Bartman and he has to fight three super villains to collect Radioactive Man's lost powers before facing the mastermind Brain-O the Magnificent.

Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by collecting radioactive signs.</desc>

In this game, you go through many obstacles, and other skateboarders shooting paint and throwing eggs at you, you also can shoot at them, and of course upgrade your board from Lester when you run into him on his skateboard, as well as Lester who will give you tricks (giving them whatever they want, whether that's fries, drinks, CD's, etc;).</desc>

		<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

		<desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

		<name>Smash Ping Pong</name>
		<desc>Smash Ping Pong simulates the game of ping-pong or table tennis in a remarkably different manner than prior simulations of any variety of tennis. Rather than putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. 

The Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games, plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty. Additionally, Deuce win conditions do not end at 15 points, but can climb as high as 99 points.</desc>

		<name>Smash T.V.</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Snake's Revenge</name>
		<desc>An unofficial sequel to the original Metal Gear for the NES. Three years has passed since the Outer Heaven incident. FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.

The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</desc>

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

		<name>Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship</name>
		<desc>The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.

At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman must return to the mother ship for repairs before continuing the quest.</desc>

		<desc>Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

		<name>Somari The Adventurer</name>
		<desc>Somari  the Adventurer is a Sonic the Hedgehog port for the NES, with a twist. Instead of Sonic, the player controls Somari, which can be described as Mario in Sonic's shoes, literally.

Overall, the gameplay is quite faithful to the original game, though Somari can spindash (by pressing down and A or B), a feature fist introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Somari has to collect rings, but unlike in Sonic, if he's hit by an enemy, only three rings will fly out of him, no matter how many rings he's currently carrying.

The level sequence is faithful to the original game, with the exception of the Scrap Brain level, which wasn't finished and thus was removed from the final product. The level design ins't faithful to the original version, with constant changes throughout the game. The items and monsters are the same found in the original game, and the music is as faithfully translated to the NES as possible, with some tempo variations.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play the role of either Son Son or Ton Ton as you try to rescue your three friends from the clutches of a random bad guy who kidnapped them right in front of you. This game is a side scrolling adventure, where the game field advances automatically, and the screen is divided in six different floors, all of which are populated by enemies or obstacles that will kill you if you touch them; but both Son Son and Ton Ton attack their enemies by shooting small bullets at them out of their weapons (a magic cane and a pitchfork, respectively). Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.

The story is heavily based upon "Journey To The West"; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story. This game is also a port of Capcom's original arcade game.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as bombs to create little explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.</desc>

		<desc>The beautiful Fairy Land has been ruled by the evil demon Geyla for a thousand years. You are a nameless spelunker who is searching for treasure. You are told to defeat Geyla and to free the Fairy Land. But you are unsure about your motivation. Do you really wish to save the world, or are just interested in all those treasures buried deep in mountain caves, waiting for you to find them and to pick them up? You have a special meter called Toku that will indicate exactly how much you are interested in saving the world, and how much in grabbing treasures. Your actions will influence the outcome of the story...

The gameplay is platform action with some RPG elements (such as the ability to use different weapons or to follow a specific style or behavior). You travel overworld through forests, fields, and mountains, whacking or shooting enemies, facing ferocious bosses, and descending underground, searching for treasure. There are many hazards that await you on your journey, including lava fields, pits, etc.</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man : Return of the Sinister Six</name>
		<desc>From the ingame intro:

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</desc>

		<name>Splatterhouse - Wanpaku Graffiti</name>
		<desc>Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.

Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.</desc>

		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<name>Sqoon</name>
		<desc>When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source – man-ham – they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.

The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.

In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.</desc>

		<name>Square No Tom Sawyer</name>
		<desc>In 1855, Tom Sawyer and his friends are growing up in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri in the United States. Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...

Square no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.</desc>

In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands.

Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of
re-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.

The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a "world map" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including "native" ones such as blowpipe and spear.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek : 25th Anniversary</name>
		<desc>The Ship Enterprise is on a 5 year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.

Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.
These away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms.  Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.</desc>

		<desc>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was a 2D platform game which was developed by Bandai for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). It was based on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier but was canceled before its intended release. The incomplete game was inconsistent with many plot and character elements of the finished film.

In 2006, a four-stage prototype version was leaked online as a ROM image file that can be played either through PC emulation or on an actual NES.

The first two stages and final stage were in the form of a side-to-side shooter. The third stage entailed space combat in which the player took the USS Enterprise-A through an asteroid field and then into battle against a Klingon cruiser near the "creation planet".</desc>

		<desc>CosmoStation Noah, located in Spiral Galaxy IX, is under siege by Molok Wardrivers. Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

		<name>Stealth ATF</name>
		<desc>Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.

In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.

Your view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.

Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.

The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Stick Hunter - Exciting Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Stick Hunter: Exciting Ice Hockey is a game for the Famicom released only in Japan in 1987. It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.

The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.

Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.

As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.</desc>

		<desc>Save Professor Cinnamon!  When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two TwinBee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy!  

In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

		<desc>The player is Ken, the hero of the Street Fighter series. It's been 25 years since he last participated in a fighting tournament. He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!

Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.</desc>

		<desc>The Striders are a global organization of infiltration specialists who work to combat villainy and keep the world safe. From their orbital space station, the Blue Dragon, they are able to quickly reach anywhere in the world.

Hiryu is one of the top striders. He is given the task by Vice-Director Matic, of finding another captured strider, Kain. But rather than mount a rescue, Hiryu is told his assignment is to kill Kain. Hiryu questions these orders and travels to Kain's last known location to try to find him...

Strider is a platform game where Hiryu must fight his way past enemies and uncover keys, characters and data disks (which can be analysed aboard the Blue Dragon) to find out what's going on. His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of "skills" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).</desc>

		<desc>The StudyBox, released by Fukutake Publishing Co, Ltd., was much like a tape player for the Famicom. The accessory was small enough to fit on top of the Famicom, to plug into the connector. Also like a tape player, the top of the StudyBox would open to reveal the compartment where tapes were played.

The StudyBox itself did not have the standard Play, Stop, Pause, Fast Forward and Rewind buttons on the system, as would be expected with a tape player. Instead, the student (presumably) would use the Famicom controller and on-screen cues to play the tapes.

We donâ€™t exactly know what the tapes would do. The purpose of the StudyBox was to make the Famicom more educational, giving students the ability to learn about whatever information was contained on the tapes. The tapes were, of course, only sound and voice, without visuals to accompany the studying.</desc>

		<desc>Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation.

The back-story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the countryside. Of course, what kind of game would it be if there weren't fearless heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.

The four Dice Heroes are your basic stock-issue fantasy characters. There's the fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced. You must pick one of these characters before each level, and you're stuck with them until you finish.</desc>

Gameplay consists of riding a skateboard through various obstacles and defeating enemies who try to hinder the player's progress.

Fishfall is a game where the player controls a hand trying to catch as many freefalling fish as possible and then throwing them upwards toward a moving basket in order to meet a quota.

4HIM: The Ride isn't a game per se, but a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him.</desc>

Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. Also, unlike most video games of this time, it was never even announced. Most cancelled games saw months' worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.</desc>

If they do this, you can kick their Arabian butt and knock them off the screen. If you manage to kick two or more enemies at once, something will hit you that will make you invincible for a few seconds.

It doesn't matter about the order in which you collect the pots. However, each pot has a different letter on it, and if you collect the pots in the order that they appear at the top-right of the screen, you will receive a whopping 5000 points. After you collect the pots, you move on to the next level.  There are four levels in each part (section), and each part has a theme to them. In Part 1, Level 1, for instance, you have to collect the letters that make up the word ANIMAL. In subsequent levels, you have to create words that are actual animals (HORSE, RABBIT, MONKEY). Also, if you take too long to complete the level, a red genie will emerge from one of the pots and will attack you.</desc>

You create a party (up to five members) and explore a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. You also meet adventurers whom you can convince to join your party.

Super Boy Allan is the second game in Sunsoft's "Intelligence Game" edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes.

The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.

The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.</desc>

The player starts with 4 lives as opposed to 3 (although the stat screen displays 5 lives at the start) and 6 continues instead of 3. The standard enemies are similar to those in the originals, but they speed up when they reach the middle of the screen and never shoot. The level designs are considerably more basic than those in Contra and are mostly original, although the first half of Area 4 bears a strong resemblance to Area 4 from Super C.</desc>

		<name>Super Contra X</name>
		<desc>Super Contra X is a pirate based off the Contra series, created by Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co sometime in the 1990's. (Likely 1994).
 This isn't a complete clone of Contra or any games in the series, but instead tries to remake the engine and use it in completely different levels. Most of the weapons from that game are present, but function differently. The default gun is similar to the original, but sometimes pressing the fire button doesn't shoot a bullet when it's supposed to due to unresponsive controls. The machine gun fires slower and and doesn't allow you to fire while jumping. The spread gun only fires in three directions and the laser is more like the one from Contra 4 in that you can fire multiple shots on the screen at once and that the shots don't disappear when you fire repeatedly. Occasionally in certain spots, the player can die for no reason. Many consider the game to be incredibly difficult because of unresponsive controls and poor programming.</desc>

Play the World Cup mode and take on teams from around the world to claim the championship. You play as the star USA team and must work your way through teams from countries such as England, Iceland, Japan, and more to finally take on the current ruling world champions, the Soviet Union.

Or you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose.

Or, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.</desc>

		<desc>Super Donkey Kong - Xiang Jiao Chuan is a Donkey Kong Country bootleg for the Famicom. The developer is believed to be Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co with Liang Yi Productions as the publisher.

While this game takes many elements from Donkey Kong Country, it's more of an original game than a port. The player can only choose to be either Donkey or Diddy Kong and you play through the whole game with only one. They lose a life after three hits as opposed to one as shown in the top left.

A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running. It's also been noted that the Kongs themselves feel rather slippery when attempting to stop, especially when running.</desc>

		<name>Super Dyna'mix Badminton</name>
		<desc>Radically different from other racquet sports such as tennis, badminton uses a high-drag shuttle which gives it an irregular path. In this video game adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different courts can be chosen.

Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return drastically.</desc>

Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance.

The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. 

While trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack by a range of creature, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work. The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue the Commander.</desc>

In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.

A player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the "What is..." question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Douglas E. Smith's Lode Runner was introduced to Japan in 1983 on various popular Japanese home computer platforms, including the MSX, Sharp X1, and NEC PC family computers. Hudson Soft licensed the rights to bring the game to Nintendo's Famicom, and it was released in 1984 as one of the first 3rd party games ever made for the system and it was an incredible hit. Around the same time, Irem licensed the rights to produce an arcade version of Lode Runner which they also released in 1984, along with three other sequels through 1986. These arcade versions made a few tweaks to the original game play, and the final arcade game introduced a two player cooperative mode.

In 1987, Irem decided to package a number of select stages from all four of the arcade games into one title, and released it in disk format for the Famicom Disk System, entitled Super Lode Runner. Though the graphics were not quite as good as the arcade games, they were close, and Irem brought many of the game play changes to Famicom players, including the new two player mode. Irem released a sequel later on that same year. A different version of the game was released for the MSX with the same title.</desc>

		<desc>Super Mogura Tataki!! Pokkun Mogura ("Super Mole Bash!! Pokkun Mole") is an action game for Famicom based on the classic fairground/arcade game "whac-a-mole". The goal is to hit the moles as they poke out from eight different spots on the ground before they quickly duck their heads back down. Later stages switch the moles with other animals and characters to quickly bop.
The game was released with a rubber mallet and a special smaller Power Pad peripheral (known in Japan as the Family Trainer) with a grid of buttons that corresponded to the holes that the moles would emerge from. Because the Power Pad had twelve buttons, the different stages could be configured differently: for instance, the first level had a ring of eight buttons on the right side of the pad, whereas the next level included the left, right, and bottom row of buttons to form its eight around an island in a U shape.</desc>

It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

		<name>Super Real Baseball '88</name>
		<desc>Super Real Baseball '88 is a baseball game developed by Pax Softonica for the Famicom and published in Japan by Vap in 1988. After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.

To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.</desc>

The game uses a top-down perspective of the pitch with the two sides oriented vertically, and the player is able to assign points to various stats before playing a match to focus on certain areas of their playstyle. Options include a one-off "Training" exhibition match, a "League" game which pits the player against several CPU teams, and a "Vs." mode for two human players to compete.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2525, things are a mess. politically. Terrorists led by someone named "X" want to attack the United Nations. The CIA is in charge of discouraging the attacks. To that end, and since all of their best agents have failed the task, they send out an unofficial agent -- you, the Super Spy Hunter.

The Super Spy Hunter has a super spy car. It's actually a well-armed car that can turn into a boat or a plane at opportune times. The action is fast vertical scrolling as the vehicle faces all manner of powerful vehicle threats from a well-funded terrorist enemy -- cars, trucks, helicopters, etc. Luckily, there are many powerups to collect along the way, both defensive and offensive.</desc>

		<desc>In the Almanac dimension, the year 2010 brought in the final destruction of the evil planet Gordess by the space patroller Final Star. However, this doesn't bring closure of what happened in the past and how the planet Gordess came into existence. So now it's up to Commander Ralph to travel in time through six distinct time periods in the Neo Final Star space patroller and finally figure what exactly caused Gordess to come into existence.

Gameplay involves flying in a vertically scrolling shooter defeating various enemies in order to collect time pieces. Time pieces can be spent at teleporters so that the player can travel to different time periods and also these time pieces can be spent at shops in order to buy equipment.

The player can also find buildings to enter into. The game turns from being a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up to an isometric dungeon exploration shooter. The main objective in these areas is to locate one of the seven time stones.</desc>

		<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

		<desc>Like other entries in the series, Super Turrican for the NES is a side-scrolling platformer in which players explore large levels filled with enemies items and secret areas. Three different, upgradable weapons are available: multiple (spreadshot), laser and rebound. Holding down the fire button activates a rotatable laser that is useful for discovering hidden power-up capsules.

Despite carrying the same name as one of its big brothers, Super Turrican for the NES is based on Turrican and Turrican II. While some levels are very similar to those found in Turrican I and II (with only slight changes of layout and enemy types), others are entirely new. 

Apart from different/new level design, there are other notable changes: Holding down the fire button let's Turrican run, there is no time limit to levels anymore, energy wheel usage is limitless and the shield isn't time based anymore, but can sustain a certain number of hits.</desc>

Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles.

It is your job, as a fighter pilot, to blast them away! Destroy everything in sight!

Some ground structures that must be destroyed are hidden and are called Sol Citadels. To locate these hidden structures you must keep an eye on the target-sight that will flash when it goes over the structures.

Some examples of improvements are, for instance, the shield option and the upgrade option.
The shield protects you from immediately death if you got hit during an attack.
The upgrade option gives you the possibility to upgrade your bombs, lasers and shields.</desc>

		<desc>SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics is a role-playing game developed by Shouei and published by Toei Animation. This game was only ever released in Japan for the Famicom and was never translated from the original Japanese language.

The player takes control of a five member team of special anti-terrorist agents as they break into a building where a hostage situation is taking place. Their goal is to take out the villains and free the hostages. Battles with gunmen take place in a traditional RPG style turn-based battle. Players enter the commands for each surviving member of the team, including what weapon to attack with, and which target to attack. When not in battle, the player views the building in a traditional 3D dungeon perspective, moving through the hallways, choosing which rooms to investigate, which traps to disarm, and how to proceed to the end of the game within a given time limit.</desc>

		<desc>"Sweet Home" follows the exploits of five members of
an investigation group: Kazuo, Akiko, Taro, Asuka, and Emi. The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

"Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

The game was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Little did they know how futile their quests would be -- they met a horrible fate at the hands of a horrible serpent king.  Can your party of champions defeat the dragon and claim the ruby treasures? Or will you, too, be vanquished?

Swords and Serpents is a first-person, party-based CRPG in the tradition of Wizardry. Put together a team of 4 heroes (roll your own characters or simply use the pre-generated party) from three classes: warrior, thief, and magician.  A 16-level dungeon awaits you, full of weapons, armor, magic spells, and other valuable items.  Beware, though: an assortment of traditional fantasy beasts and villains awaits you!  

Teleporters and "zoom tubes" speed up your travels.  Temples provide safe havens for your party to restore health and mana. An auto-map feature helps the player keep track of what locations you have visited.  A password system allows you to save your progress as you travel deeper into the darkness.</desc>

		<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

		<name>Taito Grand Prix - Eikou E No License</name>
		<desc>Taito Grand Prix: Eikou e no License is a 1987 Formula One racing video game for the Japan-exclusive Famicom. This video game takes the player through randomized street racing circuits in addition to the various circuits of the 1987 Formula One season. There are over fifteen stock car tracks and eight Formula One tracks. Open mode allows the player to practice each course individually without any pressure from anything besides the time limit. Normal mode is more restrictive; the game forces the player to roam from city to city until they end their career by winning a full season of Formula One.

There are three kinds of music (playing from a pretend cassette tape) and a blank soundtrack. The instrumental songs played in the game were: Offside Way, Crushing Light, and Faraway Dream. On the promotional flyer for this video game, a Formula One racing vehicle was shown with the Ford logo shown on the vehicle. However, there are no actual Ford Motor Company vehicles used in the entire game.</desc>

In the anime, Takahashi and Honey get into various adventures along with three ordinary school children from Earth. 
While the game draws inspiration from the anime (which itself drew inspiration from Adventure Island) the game does not necessarily follow any of the episodes of the show. Instead, the game consists of four stages. In the first stage, you control Bug-tte Honey, who has the ability to fly about the screen. At the end of the first stage, Honey rescues Takahashi by smashing the cage he is being held captive in. From that point forward, the player controls Takahashi (Called Master Higgins in the US/EU version)</desc>

		<name>Takeshi No Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>On the surface, Takeshi no Chōsenjō (aka "The Ultimate Challenge from Beat Takeshi") is a side-scrolling adventure game, where the player character can wander the streets and buildings of Tokyo, and later the islands of the South Pacific. Various people and shop-owners can be spoken with, and frequently attacked if the player so chooses.

Kitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the "Red Country" (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen ("Punch the old man") which results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or even punching the main character's wife and children (presumably to death).</desc>

It stars Japanese comedian-turned-actor "Beat" Takeshi Kitano, who first appeared on the Famicom in the parody game Takeshi no Chousenjou. Similar to the Game of Life, players move around a board earning money and occasionally encountering events such as a minigame - in which the player can increase their wealth should they succeed - or a penalty. The game has a Sengoku era theme running throughout, from its samurai characters to the tattooed gambler that rolls a dice for determining how many places a player can move around the board that turn.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.

Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic. Many strange boss creatures and devices will guard the final areas of most levels.</desc>

The game has a subtitle: 3 Choume Daibouken. The "3 Choume" part refers to the district in which Tama and his friends live, while "Daibouken" simply means "great adventure".



As a game, Tama and Friends is very basic, and quite clearly meant for very young children. The goal is to simply walk right across a suburban environment while avoiding enemies like birds and random flying junk. Tama can also climb telegraph poles to help him get higher, which occasionally lead to bonus areas, and there are also bosses to be fought at the end of certain stages.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Kiken na Futari - Zenpen  (Detective Saburou Jinguuji: Danger For Two, Part 1) is a mystery-adventure game developed by Data East for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. It is the third game of the long standing Tantei Jinguuji Saburou series, following Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. In the third mystery, the detective visits a race circuit at the invitation of one of Yulia's friends. A motorcycle racer, Sabin Olsen, crashes at the circuit, but a different racer's body is recovered from the crash site. At the same time, Sabin Olsen, at a hotel, is found where a man he was supposed to meet was killed causing Olsen to be framed as he fled the hotel. Due to memory constraints on the size of the disks, this game was broken up into two parts. This is the first part, while the second part, Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari Kouhen, was release a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Kiken na Futari - Zenpen  (Detective Saburou Jinguuji: Danger For Two, Part 1) is a mystery-adventure game developed by Data East for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. It is the third game of the long standing Tantei Jinguuji Saburou series, following Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. In the third mystery, the detective visits a race circuit at the invitation of one of Yulia's friends. A motorcycle racer, Sabin Olsen, crashes at the circuit, but a different racer's body is recovered from the crash site. At the same time, Sabin Olsen, at a hotel, is found where a man he was supposed to meet was killed causing Olsen to be framed as he fled the hotel. Due to memory constraints on the size of the disks, this game was broken up into two parts. This is the first part, while the second part, Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari Kouhen, was release a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>Tarot Uranai (Lit. Tarot fortune telling) is a fortune telling simulation developed and published by Scorpion Soft for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. During play, the game predicts the player's future in several areas, including love, finance, and education. It followed a series of other astrological "utility" programs for the platform, including Chuugoku Senseijutsu and '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai.

The game focuses on the Tarot deck and their supposed clairvoyant properties. The game will randomly shuffle a deck and lay them out in a formation of the player's choosing - each formation is meant to predict a different aspect of the player's life. The game will then reveal cards that the player chooses and decipher the meaning behind them.</desc>

The story is about the hero Masashi Tashiro who has to rescue the four princesses in distress. One happy ending and four unhappy endings were used in the game; becoming one of the first video games to have multiple endings. The game was not very successful, but it started appearing frequently and getting high prices on online auction sites like Yahoo! after 2000, when Masashi Tashiro was arrested and convicted several times in connection with voyeurism and drug abuse.</desc>

		<desc>Probably the first game to be based on the Transformers toys, Convoy no nazo pits the player as Ultra Magnus, who must find out the secret of Convoy (known as Optimus Prime in most of the world). To find it out, Ultra Magnus must travel through a set of platform-style worlds and fight a range of bosses, ranging from the Megatron, through the combiner series to a flying Decepticon emblem(!).

Ultra Magnus starts out in robot mode, where he can jump far but his shots travel only halfway across the screen. Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot. Later on, the game becomes more platform-oriented.</desc>

		<desc>Tatakae!! Ramen-Man: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei is an adventure game developed by Human Entertainment for the Famicom and published by Bandai in 1988. It is based off the Tatakae!! Ramenman series, which itself is a spin-off of the Kinnikuman series, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman is a popular character in the Kinnikuman universe.

The game follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training. Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.</desc>

		<name>Tecmo Bowl</name>
		<desc>Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode. There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

		<desc>In Tecmo World Wrestling, you select from 10 fictional wrestlers and compete against the others for the coveted Tecmo World Wrestling Title. When your match begins you'll find you've got all the moves of the pros. You can run, climb to the top ropes, climb outside the ring, pick up your opponent, throw them over the ropes, pin them, and escape from a pin yourself. The wrestlers, such as "The British Star" Rex Beat and "The Technician" Dr. Guildo have a full assortment of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the Pile Driver, Shoulder Throw, Cobra Twist, as well as the ever-popular Slam the Guys Face Into the Metal Post maneuver. 

Before selected matches you'll be able to beef up you're wrestler's strength with three different exercises. The bottom portion of the screen is where the energetic announcer describes what is going on in the ring, move by move.</desc>

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<desc>[This item has been split and information may not be complete accurate. Users are cautioned that incorrect information may appear in the description which does not apply to this platform and needs to be revised]

The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).

The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>This was the last side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for NES. It followed the highly acclaimed Turtles II over a year later and, unlike its predecessor, doesn't have an Arcade counterpart.

The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.

The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same, in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special moves.</desc>

Where ever he investigated, he found local inhabitants who were experiencing some problem, or observing some corruption in the local government. Mito Koumon would then investigate the situation, disguised as a commoner, only to expose both the corruption and his true identity when the mystery was completely solved. In doing so, he would improve the lives of the local inhabitants, and then move on to another district to look for more problems. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated into English. It had one sequel: Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuuki.</desc>

		<name>Tenkaichi Bushi - Keru Naguuru</name>
		<desc>Tenkaichi Bushi is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game set in ancient China.

Using 2D side-scrolling graphics with a distinct cartoony design, the player takes control of a single fighter as he attempts to defeat his opponent in single-round fights. Combat is controlled with a single attack button which can unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the directional arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.

Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.</desc>

In the year 2089, humanity forms an alliance with the intergalactic Baal empire but soon Earth finds out about the alien's true intentions. A group of resistance assembles the project Tetrastar to prepare for the potential upcoming threat. But the project lead by the general Nelson is soon put on hold and a short lived peace settles in. But the whole thing was nothing more than a hostile invasion and the Baal empire finally breaks the alliance and attacks Earth. The player's first mission is to prevent New York to be destroyed and then to retrieve Omega, the faithful robot navigator, to warp to the alien's mother world. The Tetrastar super fighter can move around the screen and fire a standard Vulcan gun. Special weapons become available later in the game from Bombs (WID), Homing Missiles (AAM), Napalm Bombs (NAP) and the powerful Bio Cannon (BIO) - they are accessible via the Select button and triggered by pressing A. They all come in limited quantities and must be refilled by picking up power-pods along the way. Tetrastar features nice stages and cutscenes between them unfold the game's episodic story.</desc>

		<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

		<name>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
		<desc>Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.

Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.

BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.

BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.</desc>

Here is a full English translation for the game, Tetsudou Ou: Famicom Boardgame for the famicom system!

Now you can enjoy this fun little board-game where up to 4 players compete against each other to own the most railroads, have the most money, and get to your destinations!

In conjunction with RG-Soft's work we were able to complete this project and get 98% if the game completed. Only a few names on the board map will appear glitched due to code issues but it will in no way hinder the game play. We hope you enjoy this!</desc>

		<desc>The game stars Tetsuwan Atom, a popular early anime character who is better known as Astro Boy outside of Japan. Tetsuwan Atom was originally created in 1951 by Osamu Tezuka. The successful series started as a comic strip and was turned into a black and white animated series in 1963. It was one of the first (if not the first) animated TV series produced in Japan, and has influenced countless Japanese animated series that followed. The little robot-boy is one of Japan's most recognizable character. The story takes place in the future, at a time where humans and robots live together in harmony. The powerful robot-boy Atom lives with Professor Ochanomizu, an old scientist who takes good care of the little robot, and helps him fight crime and injustice. One day, burglars break into Professor Ochanomizu's lab and steal all of his money. It is now Atom's duty to recover the stolen loot.</desc>

		<name>Thunder &amp; Lightning</name>
		<desc>A "Breakout" type game with interesting characters such as Mr. Chin and the Thunder Warrior.  Mr. Chin holds a stick over his head that acts as the paddle.  If your ball hits one of the power-up carriers (Flying Saucer, Submarine or Airplane) you have to try and pick up the released power-up while continuing to keep the ball in play.

Power-ups are:

1. Glove: Catch the ball and then release with the A button.
Long: Mr. Chin's stick will become longer.
1-Up: Get an extra life for Mr. Chin.
Missile: Gain fire power, press the A button to launch a missile, catch a second missile to fire two missiles simultaneously.
Big Ball: The ball enlarges and blows through any type of block in its path.
Slow: This will slow the speed of the ball.
3 Balls: The ball will split into three balls and as long as you keep one ball from falling you will always have three balls.
6 Balls: The ball will split into six balls.

"Bad Characters" will occasionally appear and try to mess with Mr. Chin.

1. Sea Anemone: If he captures your ball it will split into two smaller balls.
Octopus: He lives underwater inside an ancient vase, if the vase is hit by the ball the octopus will come out and try and latch onto Mr. Chin's stick.  If he succeeds he will weigh you down causing you to move slower.
Turtle: They will walk over the wall and transform themselves into new blocks to hinder your progress.
Bird: If hit with your ball it will fly out of control smashing through the walls before flying away.
Thunder Warrior: If you hit the Thunder Warrior with your ball he will release a circle of lightning bolts that will fly around him. The lightning bolts will destroy the walls but they will momentarily paralyze Mr. Chin if he is hit.</desc>

These 3 days will be subtracted from your overall 60 days you have to beat the entire game. 

Your enemies consists of such exotic fare as poisonous space scorpions, mutant sea worms and even environmental adversaries such as fire spitting volcanoes. By defeating certain enemies, you aircraft can gain powerups such as replenishing delpleted heath, increased firepower, or adding orbital ships to fly by the side of your main ship to assist you in combat.</desc>

		<name>Thwaite</name>
		<desc>Thwaite is an NES homebrew game similar to Missile Command. In Thwaite, you have to defend the town by shooting your own missiles from the silos to explode in front of enemy missiles, much like in Missile Command. At the bottom of the screen are 10 houses and two missile silos. Missiles come in from the top of the screen toward the 12 targets at various angles, followed by about 32 pixels of smoke drawn as sprites. Occasionally (more often at higher difficulty levels), a MIRV (large missile) enters that turns into three small missiles when it reaches about halfway down the screen. Sometimes an upsidaisium balloon carrying a box will float in from the side, and once it has crossed part of the screen, the small missiles fall out of the box like with a MIRV, and the balloon floats away. If one of them lands on a house or silo, the missile and target are destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Tiger Heli is the name of your helicopter, according to the box the result of a billion-dollar defense project and forged from ebony metal and glistening chrome. Your goal is to defeat the country of Cantun, which is run by terrorists and has become completely power hungry with an aim to take over the whole world.

You're shooting tanks, ships, aircraft carriers and trains while flying towards the impenetrable military base. You shoot crates to get pickups. If you shoot the crate when it is green you get a bomb pickup, if you shoot it when it is red you get a mini helicopter that attaches to one of your sides shooting sideways, and if you shoot it when it is white you get a mini helicopter shooting forward. If you shoot 10 crates with a yellow diamond shape you get an extra life.</desc>

		<name>Tiles of Fate</name>
		<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!</desc>

		<name>Time Twist - Rekishi No Katasumi De... - Zenpen</name>
		<desc>Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de... is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System in which the protagonist is a disembodied ghost trying to track down his body, which has been taken over by a time-travelling demon. The demon is wrecking havoc across various points in history and the player, as the boy's spirit, has to try and stop it. The player has at their disposal the unique ability to possess various animals and people as well as the usual set of menu-driven commands common to Famicom adventure games.

Time Twist was created by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves, using much of the same staff that worked on the two Famicom Mukashi Bunashi (Famicom Fairy Tale) games: Shin Onigashima (New Oni Island) and Yuyuuki (Brave Spirits).

Time Twist would also be the very last game developed by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System peripheral and was also the last packaged game to be sold for the device. Later games for the peripheral would be sold entirely through the Disk Writer service. Time Twist itself would eventually be sold via the Disk Writer service as well, as packaged versions were in short supply and have since become something of a collector's item as a result.</desc>

		<desc>Oh, no! On the way to meet your girlfriend Haruka, our intrepid little hero has gotten ambushed by that nefarious, time-traveling villain, Professor Time. Now it's time to join him as he crosses time and space to save her from his evil clutches.

In this run and jump action game, you'll find yourself flung anywhere from prehistoric times to the far future and back again, defeating anything from dinosaurs to samurai to aliens just to get her back.

Your main weapon — your ever-sturdy baseball cap. Just toss it forward and let it simply boomerang back or jump as it boomerangs back to let it fly around you for a short amount of time. And if you're lucky enough to collect enough chimes, you'll get to witness the awesome destructive power and invincibility of the skateboard.

Combined that with a host of hazardous obstacles so prevalent in platformers and you've got yourself into quite a pickle trying to tackle Professor Time. Pursue and flog him with your cap so that the hero and Haruka can live happily ever after.</desc>

		<desc>Titanic (also known as Titanic 2005) is a Chinese unlicensed Famicom game.
You can choose to play as Jack or Rose, and your objective is to escape the ship. The game uses the same (or similar) gameplay engine as Dragon Co.'s other platformers, although the game does control somewhat differently. You can climb up ledges by pressing up like in Prince of Persia and the B button now just makes you run faster instead of using a weapon.
Most of the levels are standard, although there a couple of levels that play somewhat differently. One stage requires you to avoid the rising water level by ascending up the floors of the ship, while the final level has you swimming up to the surface.
Oddly, the ending is completely inaccurate to the film as the Titanic seems to be fixed somehow and Jack lives at the end.</desc>

		<name>Titanic Mystery - Ao No Senritsu</name>
		<desc>Titanic Mystery (lit. Titanic Mystery: Shiver of Blue) is an underwater exploration game developed by Activision and published by Gakken in 1987 for the Family Computer Disk System. It has a female protagonist that the player controls while searching sunken ships.

The game is slightly famous for its instruction booklet which contains a short manga-style story. Despite the fact that most Famicom users at this time were children, this manga story features the protagonist in a shower scene. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor was it ever translated from Japanese.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

The player controls a time-traveling cop who visits key figures from Japanese history, answers their questions, and gradually moves towards the present. Most of the game is presented in first-person view, with the other character facing the main character, who asks and answers questions. There are also third-person sequences where the player must return to their time machine before it leaves. Although the game offers some branching paths based on dialogue choices, its narrative is fairly linear.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring Japanese celebrity "Tokoro-san" as its protagonist, this is a run-of-the-mill jump and run game. In order to save a baby, Tokoro-san must traverse Tokyo, armed only with a water pistol. Cute nasties which look like fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot, run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold is a graphical text adventure game developed by Toei Animation for the Famicom Disk System, and published in Japan in 1988. The game is based on an anime OVA "Tooyama Sakura Uchuu Chou - Yatsu no Na wa Gold" (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Tooyama Kagemoto. Mr. Gold is a sci-fi adventure about a hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually contributed to fictional adaptations of the Tooyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme.The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.</desc>

		<path>./Top Gun.7z</path>
		<name>Top Gun</name>
		<desc>Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different missions.

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.</desc>

		<desc>Just like in the first game, you fly an F-14 Tomcat in combat against the enemy equipped with Soviet equipment, although there is no direct reference to the Soviet Union anywhere. The only plot of this game is to destroy everything you see, excluding the aircraft carrier to which you must land at the end of each level.

In addition to the basic game mode with anti-ship, ground attack and space battle levels, similar to the first game, the second mission adds two extra modes. In the first extra mode you can fight against top enemy aces flying a MiG-25 Foxbat, one at a time. The second extra mode is two-player game with split screen, in which you can fight against your friend, both flying Tomcats.

You will have to fight against interesting level bosses such as a giant Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a Mi-24 Hind attack chopper and an armed space shuttle.

Another interesting detail about the game is that between fighting the aircraft and surface opponents you have to dodge between giant trees (yes, you read correctly!!), lightnings and laser attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is also labeled as a race game. The player pilots an air craft and flies in competition against several computer controlled craft. In addition to firing upon your opponents, you may ram into them (and they may ram into you) and dislodge a power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. There are eight distinct scenes, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other scenes. How the scenes connect is random on each play through. The goal is to locate the key which is necessary to access to warp which leads to the eight and final scene, collect it from whichever scene it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth scene before any other competitor.</desc>

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, Total Recall for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels. Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by Interplay and published by Acclaim.

Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).

Sequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.</desc>

		<path>./Totally Rad.7z</path>
		<name>Totally Rad</name>
		<desc>Totally Rad is an action-adventure game in which you play Jake, a magician wannabe being trained by the Master Magician Zebediah. One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.

This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.

Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.</desc>

There are 12 teams from NFL cities to play with (six East, six West), although there is no NFL license and no real NFL players.  Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt.  There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap.  The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Standard football scoring rules: most points after four quarters wins!</desc>

The package of the game bills it as a "New wave psychedelic adventure" and the story of the game is considered quite bizarre, in which a character is transported back in time to the year 1275 where he encounters Marco Polo, and generally interferes with Polo's efforts to establish trade between Asia and Europe. The game is intended to be comedic and even parodies several game design elements which were common at the time. It has never been released outside of Japan or translated from the original Japanese.</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

Up to two players can play in a race to gather up the Trog eggs as quickly as possible.  The first player to get all eggs of their colour wins the round.

		<name>Tsuppari Wars</name>
		<desc>Tsuppari Wars ("Delinquent Wars") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.
Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars or Tsuppari Suku mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the "neutral gangs." These "neutral gangs" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying "no" when asked to fight ("Struggle").</desc>

		<name>Tsuri Kichi Sanpei - Blue Marlin Hen</name>
		<desc>Tsurikichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen (lit. Fishing Maniac Sanpei: Blue Marlin Chaper) is a fishing simulation. It was published in Japan for both the Famicom and the MSX home computer in 1988. It is based upon the Japanese manga Tsurikichi Sanpei, which was written and illustrated by Takao Yaguchi. The manga was serialised in Kodansha's Weekly Sh?nen Magazine from 1973 to 1983.
The series is about a boy who discovers that he has a talent and a huge passion for fishing, and tries to to maximize his potential by entering into different fishing contests. He encounters all kinds of rivals and companions who help him increase his skill. As he faces various challenges, he learns to solve difficult problems and learns from his mistakes to the extent that he is able to fish anything out of the water.
In the game, Sanpei is competing for the top prize in the "1988 Famicom International Billfish Tournament" by capturing the largest Blue Marlin possible.</desc>

		<path>./TwinBee.7z</path>
		<name>Twinbee</name>
		<desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

1. Yellow: grants bonus points;
2. White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
3. Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
4. Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
5. Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

Once again you take the role of either Twinbee or Winbee (Gwinbee having been kidnapped by the final boss) as they fly through the fantasy kingdom shooting the hell out of their... uhm... enemies, or whatever they are.

As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.

If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).</desc>

		<desc>Space Defence Force SDF is a vertically scrolling space shooter. Though it scrolls vertically, you are granted some movement horizontal movement as well. The action isn't frantic, but the game is still somewhat difficult due to tight enemy attack waves and the possibility of being shot in the back. For this reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in this game.</desc>

Your viewscreen is where you target alien space-craft, astronauts, moons, and planets and interact with them. The interactions allowed are:  Missile, Beam, Shiled(SIC), Move, Communicate, Computer, Parts, and State. Missile launches a rocket with adjustable strength at your target. Beam shoots a laser weapon at your target. The misspelled Shield function lets you decide if you want your shields on or not. Move button has two different sub selections; Warp and Land. Warp lets you travel from planet to planet while Land lets you deploy one of your Mechs on to the surface of a satellite or enemy cruiser. Communicate lets you do just that, communicate with planets and other vehicles. Computer gives you read-outs on targeted planets and vehicles. The Computer also is where you perform repairs on your ship or Mechs. Parts lets you see what weapons you have loaded. Finally, State, gives you detailed information pertaining to shields, weapons etc of your Cosmo Carrier and three Mechs; Gravity, Blizzard and Field.</desc>

In this multicart, you'll be able to experience the only games designed specifically for the U-Force controller. Included are the games Hose 'Em Down, Nuclear Rat Attack, Rock on Air, and Power Field B-Ball. 
In Hose 'Em Down you are in charge of a fire hose in front of a burning building. As people appear at the windows you must slowly lower them with your water blast. Go too slow and they burn to death!
Pink mutant rats are attacking your reactor in Nuclear Rat Attack. If you don't kill them fast enough they fry and meltdown the system! 
Rock on Air turns your U-Force into a theremin and lets you create music. Wave your hands around so your friends think you are crazy!
Think sports games where you just hit a button are too easy? Power Field B-Ball challenges you by having no buttons! Added two player mode with one U-Force controller ensures the hilarity doesn't stop. 
Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts. No donor carts were harmed in the making of this game.</desc>

You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.</desc>

The story? After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named "Exodus" before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and stop him.</desc>

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.</desc>

In Ultima V, you, the Avatar and Hero of Britannia, are called back to deal with a new threat - the tyrant Blackthorn, who, after the disappearance of Lord British, now rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process.

		<name>Ultimate League Soccer</name>
		<desc>In this soccer game, two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

		<path>./Ultimate Stuntman.7z</path>
		<name>The Ultimate Stuntman</name>
		<desc>Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.

Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.

The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.

Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.

The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.

The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.

In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.</desc>

		<name>Ultraman - Kaijuu Teikoku No Gyakushuu</name>
		<desc>Ultraman: Kaiju Teikoku no Gyakushu, loosely translated as "Ultraman: Counterattack of the Monster Empire" is a side scrolling platformer developed for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Bandai at the start of 1987. This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman. Ultraman 2 was a sequel developed as a simulation game, and Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen was developed as an RPG utilizing the "chibi" or super-deformed style of artwork for the characters.

The player controls Hayate, a member of the Science Special Search Party, which protects the earth from invasions of large hostile aliens. He must run across each stage, defeating enemies with his ray gun. He must also collect energy orbs to fill a meter on the screen. When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.

If all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.</desc>

		<desc>Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai!! (Loosely translated as Ultraman 2: Sortie Department Group) is an action game developed by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System and published at the end of 1987. As the title implies, it revolves around the Ultraman series that was popular in Japan. However, rather than making Ultraman the focus of this game, it is the defense support team that goes into action whenever Japan is attacked by a giant monster which gets the majority of the game time.

The game takes place in modern Japan, with a bird's eye view presentation of much of Japan's metropolis. Players must send a team out to search for, and obtain, a cube which permits the defense team to damage monsters when they appear. Once the cube is found, monsters begin to appear and attack the buildings of Japan. The team must deploy vehicles to help aid in the destruction of these monsters until they have all been defeated. If a monster destroys a critical building, the game is instantly over.</desc>

Unlike the two prior games, which were more action-oriented, this game is a turn-based RPG.</desc>

		<name>Ultraman Club - Kaijuu Daikessen!!</name>
		<desc>Ultraman Club: Kaijuu Dai Kessen!! is an action platformer for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Ultraman Club: Great Kaiju Battle is a pretty simple platformer, typical of the NES era. You walk generally right/up and beat up various bad guys from the Ultraman franchise. You can also use sub-weapons and switch between them at will. Every once in a while you get a balloon popping minigame where you can win various prizes.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that several of the Ultramen look VERY similar, with the only real differences in their artwork being around the shoulder area. This can cause a bit of confusion as to who is speaking. Just remember that after beating a boss, Ultraman Zoffy speaks to your Ultraman, your Ultraman isn't talking to himself!

After working out how text is formatted in this game, hacking it was fairly straight-forward, although the script had to be trimmed down to fit into the available space. The planet names in-between stages have proven difficult, though, so they have been left untranslated for the time being.</desc>

		<desc>It is a typical RPG based on the Ultraman series and its Ultra Warriors, as well as
various enemies and locales from the anime. Honestly, this game is REALLY clunky and slow for a game late in the Famicom's cycle. It is also extremely
frustrating due to the high amount of random enemy encounters, and overall slow pace of the game (and its battles). The menu system is not intuitive at
all, and it is annoying to navigate. Luckily it is a relatively short game, so if you can deal with fighting every 10 steps or so, check this out. Other
than that, you are really not missing much.</desc>

The Uncanny X-Men is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used up.

Power-ups include an "S" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which renders the X-men immobile for a short time.</desc>

The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

		<name>The Untouchables</name>
		<desc>The Untouchables is based on the 1987 film by Brian De Palma and works to correspond to the movie's plot outline. In 1920s Chicago, Eliot Ness and his small crew of law enforcement professionals are determined to bring down Al Capone and his gang. 

The game features 7 levels of action named The Street, The Warehouse, The Bridge, The Alleys, The Train station, The Hostage, and The Rooftop. Some of the levels feature traditional jumping and shooting action. Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.</desc>

		<desc>Two rival characters meet up one day on the city streets and arrange a fight. Both characters will start in the middle with two blocks on either side of them leading to an open manhole. The first person to knock the other into the open manhole is the winner. Only punches are allowed, although obstacles such as falling flower pots can occur and give one player the advantage. Also, everyone is to look innocent should the police drive by.

This is a very early and simplistic fighting game. As mentioned, each player can only punch the other, trying to knock them off the screen and towards one of the waiting manholes.</desc>

		<name>Urusei Yatsura - Lum No Wedding Bell</name>
		<desc>Players take on the role of Lum, a female alien princess from the anime / manga Urusei Yatsura. The game shows Lum going through different stages of her life (from childhood to adulthood) fighting off alien invaders, until she is finally old enough to marry Ataru.

Gameplay stages involve climbing up several floors of a building in order to get to a waiting UFO. Lum can't dilly-dally though, as the building she is climbing up is on fire and the flames are constantly rising. Enemies are also in the way to impede Lum's path. Lum can shoot at these enemies with lightning bolts. Lum can also pick up power-ups such as ones that can increase the players score, grant her temporary invincibility, and let her enter a bonus stage where Lum has to shoot down flying enemies.

This game was also released in the arcades as Momoko 120. However, the graphics were altered because it lacked the Urusei Yatsura license.</desc>

		<path>./Ushio to Tora - Shinen no Daiyou.7z</path>
		<name>Ushio To Tora - Shinen No Daiyou</name>
		<desc>Based on the animé series Ushio &amp; Tora, this game tells the story of a boy named Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!

The game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early "interactive fiction" adventures.

Ushio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game as the SNES action title "Ushio &amp; Tora".</desc>

		<desc>While ostensibly a traditional platform game in which the player controls Kawauso-kun, the game has gained renown for being one of the earliest titles to attempt to break away from the video game conventions of the time. Among other convention-flouting novelties that the game offers are a series of fake title screens that the player must pass through at the start, and the allowance of the main character to traverse the background at times to bypass pits of spikes that otherwise appear impossible to cross

In addition, the character's attack requires the player to hold down the attack button as the game cycles through the possible special moves with the more powerful attacks only highlighted for a short period of time.</desc>

Here the character rides on a bike and tries to shoot a set number of enemies within 1 minute while trying to not being hit. For each hit the character receive experience and eventually level ups.</desc>

		<name>Wacky Races</name>
		<desc>Despite what the name implies, Wacky Races for NES is not a racing game, and has nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

		<name>Wagyan Land</name>
		<desc>Wagan Land is a platform game series released produced by Namco (now Namco Bandai Games) that has been sold exclusively in Japan.

The series stars Wagan, a mysterious creature resembling a green mechanical dinosaur who must protect his homeland of Wagan Land from the mad scientist Dr. Devil. The games features standard side-scrolling stages where the player must reach the goal, as well as boss encounter where the player must compete in a mini-game such as concentration and shiritori. 

The objective of the game is to reach the end of each action scene by making the best use of Wagan's sound wave attacks and jumping ability. The player must confront a boss at the end of certain stages, but instead of actually fighting the boss in battle, the player is challenged to a mini-game where they must score more points than their opponent. The graphics in this installment featured simple backgrounds with bright colors. The boss theme that was later used in Wagan Land 2 and Super Wagan Land was first used in this installment for the shiritori and concentration mini-games.</desc>

The player begins the game by choosing one of four character groups which consist of three different Konami characters. Most of the levels are spoofs of various different levels from Konami games. The gameplay is mostly like a straightforward platform game, similar to Contra. In these levels you start off with the main character Rickle (or Rikkuru), who by collecting a special power-up, can transform temporarily into one of the three different characters the player chose at the beginning of the game. There are also space shooter, driving, and puzzle levels. After certain levels you can choose different paths which consist of different stages.</desc>

		<name>Wakusei Aton Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Wakusei Aton Gaiden ("Planet Aton Side-Story") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that was created by the Japanese National Tax Agency (Kokuzeichou) in order to teach children and older players about the issues surrounding Japan's bubble economy by way of a sci-fi themed parable. The story concerns the eponymous planet Aton and two young pilots who attempt to save it from some sort of economy-based crisis - one that just so happens to manifests itself as an alien invasion. The game can be played by one or two players, with player one assuming the role of the male pilot Kanta while the second player assumes the role of the female pilot Yuki.

The game was made accessible to players via a system not unlike the Disk Writer service, though presumably as a government-funded game it was made freely available. It is thought that copies were given away at some manner of a Japanese tax awareness convention or from an educational group that went to various schools across the country to lecture students. As with many Disk Writer exclusive games, it is extremely difficult for modern day Famicom collectors to find.</desc>

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</desc>

The game features two types of gameplay. First, players start out in the Space World. Players control the monster fighter from a top down perspective. The player is equipped with a weapon that can be used to fire at the enemy monsters. The monster fighter can only walk in the four cardinal directions and thus only fire straight forward in whatever direction he is currently facing. The objective is to eliminate all the enemy monsters from the playfield to clear a level. Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row, will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points. Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA. Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.</desc>

		<desc>Wayne's World is an adventure game based on the movie with the same name. The game itself is a classic point and click adventure, and should not be confused with the platform game based on the movie.

You play both Wayne and Garth, and you can switch between them at any time. The plot is simple; In an attempt to save their tv-show, Wayne and Garth decide to hold a pizza-thon (a charity show with a pizza-theme) in order to raise money. In order to be able to hold the pizza-thon Wayne and Garth must embark on several quests to collect items and hire people they need for the show. The adventure includes participating in babe-jeopardy, joining a biker's gang and baking pizza. The graphics are in 2D and the sound contains several samples from the movie.</desc>

		<name>WCW World Championship Wrestling</name>
		<desc>WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance. 
Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.

Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.</desc>

		<name>Werewolf : The Last Warrior</name>
		<desc>An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.

You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.

There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</desc>

		<name>Wheel of Fortune : Featuring Vanna White</name>
		<desc>Wheel of Fortune: featuring Vanna White is one of a series games based on the famous TV game show. The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.

This NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels. 

The Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually bears the likeness of Vanna White. Also, there are avatars for the player contestants, and the wheel animation is different.</desc>

These totems are guarded by fearsome bosses at the end of different environments spread throughout the land. Each totem gives Soaring Eagle a new power to help him complete his journey.

Whomp 'Em is a side scrolling action platformer. The hero can run, jump, and attack with his spear. Not only can he jab forward with his spear, Soaring Eagle can also stab upwards or downwards while jumping. Further, he can use his spear to defend from attacks coming from above.

Soaring Eagle must first conquer a bossless, introductory level. From there, he is free to choose from among 6 different lands to explore: Fire test, ice ritual, secret cliff, water test, magic forest, and sacred woods. Each level is highly unique with its own dangerous enemies and lethal boss. After completing these 6 areas and collecting the associated totems, Soaring Eagle is whisked off to a cloud realm where he must use all of his accumulated power to defeat a much larger enemy.</desc>

While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot.

		<name>Win, Lose or Draw</name>
		<desc>Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. 

In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.</desc>

Many wars were caused by nations wanting to have control over this powerful artifact. Thankfully, a king of the Rameru family gained possession of the wing and ordered that it be hidden away in a cave so peace would finally reign between the warring nations, and peace did indeed reign, for a while at least. Hundreds of years later, a descendant of the king, named Darutos, stumbled upon the location of the wing and decided to use it for his own ends. He summoned demons to take over his family's castle to claim it as solely his own. The remaining Rameru family line now have formed an alliance to gain back the castle and put a stop to Darutos. They decided there only hope is a magic wielding warrior named Lucia.</desc>

		<desc>The console version of Wit's, while playing very similarly to the arcade version, still has a few slight overall differences. While the arcade version has you progress through 99 levels, the console version has, much like the Mega Man series, a stage select screen where you choose the opponent you're to face off against. Each of the five initial levels consists of five rounds and features a different gameplay gimmick that you'll have to master. In addition to the single player game, the game also features various multiplayer modes for up to four players.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.

The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Knight of Diamonds, The Second Scenario</name>
		<desc>Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is exactly the same as its predecessor; a tile, or grid based movement, first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to recover the pieces of armor that had once belonged to the Knight of Diamonds.

Unlike the original PC version, characters cannot be imported from the first game and a new party must be created. The game begins with 6 default characters already created and outfitted, so the player can build a full party and enter the maze immediately. However, the player may also choose to create their own characters with the desired race, alignment, stats, class, and equipment.</desc>

		<name>Wizards &amp; Warriors III : Kuros...Visions of Power</name>
		<desc>The third installment of Wizards &amp; Warriors for the NES divulges during the intro that the evil wizard Malkil was not actually vanquished at the end of the second game. In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.

The third game in the Wizards &amp; Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.

The gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.</desc>

		<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<name>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</name>
		<desc>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is based on the television series of the same name, which is in turn based on the Lucas/Spielberg movie franchise starring Harrison Ford. In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.

The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against copious enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat powerups which allow him to sustain more damage.</desc>

		<name>Ys</name>
		<desc>You are Adol (Aron in Sega Master System version) Christian, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day you encounter a fortuneteller who sends you on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long you learn that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys!

Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</desc>

		<name>Ys 2 - Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter</name>
		<desc>This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...

This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I &amp; II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.</desc>

		<desc>Adol's long time friend, Dogi wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

		<desc>Yuu Maze ("Maze Play") is a single-screen maze game akin to Namco's classic Pac-Man and its many other imitators in that the goal of the game is to drive the futuristic vehicle around a maze collecting dots while avoiding (or temporarily eliminating) the enemies. Taito, one of the largest manufacturers of Arcade games at the time (not to mention the creators of Space Invaders), would produce similarly Arcade-reminiscent games for the system in order to tap into the portion of the market nostalgic for classic Arcade experiences.Yuu Maze adds a few innovations to the format: Each maze has a different structure, different enemies and different lay-outs for the pellets that are required to complete the level; the player can find power-ups which grant weapons, shields and speed-ups to their vehicle. The player's vehicle also has some degree of inertia: There's a slight delay when attempting to accelerate after stopping or performing a U-turn, but if the player keeps moving and changes direction only at 90 degree intervals, they can keep moving at their maximum speed. This is often necessary to keep ahead of the fast moving enemies.</desc>

		<desc>ZANAC A.I. is a 2D shoot them up game. You are flying fighter model ZANAC, a ship built by 256 Riot Fleet as man's last hope against total annihilation. On board are special weapons to help you blast your way through twelve screens of enemy creatures and destroy the system's home base. Zanac is divided into 12 "areas", which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to jungles and from oceans to industrial zones, featuring many different types of enemies.

Zanac's unique artificial intelligence program can intensify the action based upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System". Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position your ship in the screen, the place you last died; the shoot speed of the enemies and bosses do also vary.

At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses are mainly based around huge, screen-filling bunker bases consisting of gun turrets and a "core". You have limited time for fighting against the area boss - a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.</desc>

He has been assigned by a group a green, pointy-headed aliens to come to earth and stop environmental pollution by any means necessary. Eventually, he will have to find the big polluter, Lord Contaminous. The gameplay consists of side scrolling and isometric 3D scrolling action. Zen can run, jump, slice with this stick, or use powerups as the game requires.

One stage has Zen planting time bombs in a toxic factory and attempting to escape within 99 seconds. Standing in his way are roving lasers, security robots, and floating conveyor belts. The second stage takes place in an acid rain-drenched forest. Zen must revive the flowers in the forest with his photon stick while beating off acid rain-spewing floating mechanical devices.

The next stage takes place on an off shore oil rig that is going up in flames. Zen must grab fire extinguisher powerups and rescue trapped rig workers while dodging sentient oil slicks and raining fireballs. Another stage is called the High Speed Railway stage. The goal is to stop the garbagemen spreading nuclear waste. Zen is in a mining cart racing underground and fighting other enemies in carts. Zen can make this cart jump, which we will have to do often in order to survive the dangers of the mine.</desc>

Gameplay consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage.

However, when encounters with enemies occur, the game switches to a first-person perspective, allowing you to battle other Zoids from a view similar to that in Battlezone. The world view uses a system called "Symbol Encounters," which lets the player see enemy Zoids that are tracking and attacking them. Battles occur when the player enters the same space as an enemy Zoid, at which point the player can choose to flee or engage the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>The city of Palma has always been protected by the spirits of the four elements. However, Dolgo, the spirit of the earth, revolts and makes off with the Life Seeker, the controller of the world's life energies, to his underground lair. In doing so, the people of Palma begin to lose their very souls. The spirit of the air has ordered that a champion needs to be found, to retrieve the Life Seeker from the clutches of Dolgo. You are that champion.

Zombie Hunter is an action role-playing game, somewhat similar to Zelda II with its side-scrolling battles. You receive experience from defeating your enemies and you have an inventory complete with armor and weapons.</desc>

		<name>Zombie Nation</name>
		<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.</desc>

		<name>Zooming Secretary</name>
		<desc>Playing the role of a secretary in her trial period at a new job, you have to work your way through an increasingly difficult week without being fired for failing to answer calls on time. Each single screen level (wrapping on both horizontal and vertical axes) consists of an arrangement of platforms and staircases upon which are placed a number of phones and filing cabinets. When a phone rings, the topic that the call is about is represented by a symbol above the handset - and your task is to run to the matching filing cabinet then answer the call before the phone rings off. It starts of simple enough, with day one based on a symmetrical level with only two phones and two cabinets, but the difficulty soon ramps up with devious platform placement and a variety of obstructive NPC's thrown into the mix. The boss slows you down with his unhelpful remarks (just like in real life) and chatting with the office gossip-girl can leave you confused and swap over the topic currently held in your single-track mind. Then there's the delivery guy knocking people over and the oh-so-essential and distracting office romance - although thankfully there is also a coffee machine to provide you with a caffeine-fuelled speed boost to help you overcome all these obstacles. It's a simple yet compulsive concept that would work equally well as a browser-based casual game or modern console indie title, so to see Zooming Secretary make it's debut on the original 'family computer' is particularly exciting.</desc>

		<name>Zunou Senkan Galg</name>
		<desc>Zunou Senkan Galg ("Brain Battleship Galg"), referred to as just Galg by the game's title screen, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player must navigate a serious of canyon-like environments for missing pieces to a war machine. Each stage has at least one piece, so the player must visit them all in order to find the necessary number. In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a "RPG" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.

Like The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.

Though it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named "Team Bioteckers". Galg is their only known video game credit.</desc>

		<desc>3D Block is a pirated port of Blockout, made for the Famicom by Hwang Shinwei in 1989. There are three versions: a 1989 version credited to Hwang Shinwei and a 1990 version credited to "RCM Group" with a slightly different title screen. A 1991 version exists on some multicarts and credits both. This is an adaptation of Blockout, which in itself is a 3D version of Tetris. This is emphasized with the cartridge itself, having the artwork ripped from the original game. In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.</desc>

		<path>./10-Yard Fight.7z</path>
		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.

Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.</desc>

Use twitch-style skills to recognize different languages and stop blocks from being added to the construction of the tower. Choose from a variety of languages to use, and get the people separated! In case it wasn't already obvious, this game is based on the story of the Tower of Babel in the Book of Genesis. The object is to assign words from various languages to different people in order to confuse and split them up. This must be completed before they can add their blocks to the tower. For each new climber you must hold the d-pad in the direction which corresponds to their color, then assign them the given word in the correct language. You are given two possible choices for each word, but only one is in the desired language. The meta goal is to learn how to identify different languages at a glance.</desc>

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<desc>Nomolos: Storming the CATsle is a homebrew 2D side-scrolling platformer starring a cat in armour called Nomolos. The story starts when two cats, Solomon and Snow, are playing together when a portal suddenly appears. A giant purple arm shoots out from it and yanks Snow inside. Solomon follows right away and is transported, becoming the feline warrior Nomolos in the process. Going through twelve levels (with an additional hidden bonus level / warp zone) Nomolos pursues the purple enemy that is brining snow to the CATsle.

In addition to the platforming there are many enemy types and three weapons, both melee and ranged. Power-ups can also be found and picking up a mouse restores a heart. The game contains five boss encounters and there are three difficulty levels selected from the main menu. The game music contains chiptune renditions of famous classical music composers.</desc>

		<name>The Legends of Owlia</name>
		<desc>The Legends of Owlia is Gradual Games' second release for the NES.
It is an action-adventure game inspired by StarTropics, Crystalis, and the Legend of Zelda.

Once upon a time. On a world far beyond imagining. Six great owls brought forth a land called Owlia. Together, they reigned in peace and wisdom for eighty thousand years. However, their pride in the beautiful land and sky of Owlia led them to forget the vast vast seas... Mermon, King of the Mermen, oft rose to the surface to view the Land of Owlia. His desire for sunlight, sky, and green forests grew until he decided the seas were not enough for him. He endeavored to summon the six great owls one by one. He began sapping their powers of flight, empowering his minions to float towards the Land of Owlia to claim it for his own. However, one great owl eluded him.. Silmaran, the White King. Soaring high above the Land of Owlia, as Mermon's forces grew in power, he searched for one who might heed his call to rescue the great owls and restore the Land of Owlia.
Guide heroine Adlanniel and her owl friend Tyto to free the great owls and defeat Mermon king of the Mermen!!</desc>

		<desc>Uwol enjoys a quiet retirement at his cozy house in the beach of Pepinoni (province of Badajoz), so he doesn't realize that somebody has stolen all his money from the bank. Luckly, his good ol' friend Meemaid, the evil sorceress-turned-super heroine learned about the incident as she was using the ATM in the very moment the bank was being robbed.

That's why they decide to head back over to the new and refurnished Storm Palace to regain the lost fortune. But it won't be easy? the new basement is deep and full of dark corners. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles. And that's what happened: Uwol and Meemaid got lost and reached in the deepest side of the labyrinth ? where Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, plus the death murderer and the children's favourite Cthulhy dwell. So you may guess it won't be an easy task to escape with the money!</desc>

		<name>Thwaite</name>
		<desc>Thwaite is an NES homebrew game similar to Missile Command. In Thwaite, you have to defend the town by shooting your own missiles from the silos to explode in front of enemy missiles, much like in Missile Command. At the bottom of the screen are 10 houses and two missile silos. Missiles come in from the top of the screen toward the 12 targets at various angles, followed by about 32 pixels of smoke drawn as sprites. Occasionally (more often at higher difficulty levels), a MIRV (large missile) enters that turns into three small missiles when it reaches about halfway down the screen. Sometimes an upsidaisium balloon carrying a box will float in from the side, and once it has crossed part of the screen, the small missiles fall out of the box like with a MIRV, and the balloon floats away. If one of them lands on a house or silo, the missile and target are destroyed.</desc>

So she has to collect at least eight flies on her way to the toilet (which is located uhm… straight to the right) for the King to let her use it. The path is full of baddies which can hurt Lin Lin very badly, but luckily she can bounce on them with her butt. So good her mother made her eat so many mantous! If a baddie touches Lin Lin she will lose part of her clothes and will be vulnerable. Luckily you can regain your clothes with an item. If Lin Lin falls off a ledge or gets hurt by a baddie she will have to start over, unless she touches a magic poo to save her progress. If she gets killed, she'll be respawned where the poo was. Lin Lin also knows that if she happens to get to the frog with more than 8 flies, she'll gain access to the celestian realm (i.e. the bonus stage) where she can gain some extra flies which will count for the second segment of each level… … which has an autoadvancing scroll. Lin Lin shouldn't let the screen go faster than her, she must RUN. And she still has to collect the flies. And pee.</desc>

		<desc>6-in-1 is an unlicensed game that contains a set of six different game in one cartridge that were not released separately. Most of these games is known to have a major resemblances to other games such as Soko-Ban and Pang. It includes the six following games.

Cosmos Cop: A game that is heavily inspired by Space Harrier, in which the player takes control of the Cosmos Cop with the mission to take out an alien terrorist organization in outer space . You have to fly past all of the obstacles and shoot all of the enemies throughout five stages, with the final sixth stage being a boss fight.

Magic Carpet 1001: This game is a side-scrolling shooter where you are on a magic carpet, armed with only a bow and some arrows to defend yourself from the enemies in the sky throughout four different levels.

Balloon Monster is similar to the game Pang. A huge, bouncing bubble is attacking you from the sky and you have to shoot at it before it kills you. When you try to shoot it, it divides into smaller bubbles, making it harder. This game contains 50 different levels to play through.

Adam and Eve: in this game, you are Adam from the Bible. This game is nothing more than a Balloon Fight clone where the player is supposed to rid the screen of all the floating snakes to make it to the next stage. The player must defeat the floating snakes by popping their balloons then their parachutes. The game also contains an air pump powerup which heals the players damaged balloons. This game contains 40 different levels to play through.

Porter is a puzzle game similar to the game Soko-Ban. In this game, you have to move all of the boxes onto the stars in a limited amount of time, in order to make it to the next stage. This game contains 25 different levels to play through.

Bookyman: is similar to the arcade game Make Trax where you are a bug and you have to paint the entire maze before you are caught by the other enemies. This game contains 8 different levels to play through, with enemies getting increasingly faster the higher the level.</desc>

In race mode, two players can compete in a race. By pressing a button at the right time, they can build up their horse's power, then press another button to release it and give their horse an edge in the race. The player who does this faster and more accurately will have a better chance of winning the race.

In gamble mode, 1 to 6 players start out with 500 credits to place bets on 5 horses. The race will be simulated without any player interaction, and at the end of each race event players will get their respective prize money. The goal is to earn more money this way than any other player.</desc>

		<path>./Ai Senshi Nicol.nes</path>
		<name>Ai Senshi Nicol</name>
		<desc>Ai Senshi Nicol, or "Love Warrior Nicol," tells the story of Nicol, whose sweetheart Stella is taken by a Metroid-like alien while they are on a romantic walk, told in an intro cutscene with hilarious Engrish punctuation. As a result, Nicol decides to take on the entire invading alien race to save Stella, which means he must navigate a bunch of maze-like levels, collecting powerups and hitting switches to progress. Your goal in each stage is to collect three different diamonds to power your hovercraft to the next area, and many are, naturally, guarded by bosses.
Overall it plays a lot like the on-foot parts of Blaster Master, except with tighter design and controls. Each level is structured like a Zelda dungeon, flip screen scrolling and all, where you must explore every available path methodically to uncover secrets and open the next path. It's all action, though, with nary any block puzzles in sight. Much like Metroid, many power-ups have the double feature of giving you extra power or defence while also acting as a "key" to unlocking a new path, such as a gun that destroys a certain type of block, or shoes that let you jump further.</desc>

		<path>./Aladdin 2.nes</path>
		<name>Aladdin 2</name>
		<desc>Like Aladdin by Super Game, this game is a port of the Mega Drive version of Aladdin. This port is often considered to be much worse than those two, suffering from poor programming, controls and collision detection, as well as numerous other flaws. The story was completely omitted from this game, apart from an ending being present. Upon starting the game the player is given the option to start on any of the 8 levels that this game has.
All of the levels are based off those from the original game. The controls are awkward, with the player having to press Select to throw apples. The hit detection is poor, with attacks that clearly hit the enemy not registering much of the time. The player has a health meter, represented by the blue smoke coming out of the oil lamp on the top left of the screen, although because it only changes graphically every few hits, it's difficult to tell how many hits they can take before losing a life. Upon losing a life, the game sends the player to a continue screen, unless they have run out of lives, in which case it will show the Game Over screen. The collision detection is flawed, with the player often missing platforms they appear to land on from jumping. As well as this, about halfway through Level 1 (Agrabah Market), the player has to jump down from a building, although they go through it instead. Shortly afterwards, there's a section where the player falls about halfway into the ground.

The graphics are based off those from the Mega Drive Aladdin, but seem to be hand-drawn rather than ripped and edited to suit the console. The characters are much smaller to prevent sprite flicker, about the same size as that of Virgin Interactive's version and smaller than the other pirated ports. Strangely, most of the people (apart from Aladdin himself) have green or blue skin for unknown reasons. Also, the start of Level 3 (Sultan's Dungeon) starts off with a glitched background. The music is remade from the original as well, and downgraded considerably. The ending is an image with Aladdin and Jasmine kissing and a "The End" message, followed by a credits screen in Chinese.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate League Soccer</name>
		<desc>In this soccer game, two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you control a little baby! The baby crawls through imaginary worlds, made of candy, chocolate, toys, and other things a baby would dream of. It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.</desc>

Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>During the final days of Shang-Yin dynasty in China (11th century BC), general Li Jing had a son named Ne Zha. The boy had extraordinary talents for martial arts, and for that reason the god Tai Yi gave him three powerful artifacts. One day he went to swim in the sea and disturbed the prince of dragons. The prince became angry and went out of the water to fight Ne Zha. Unaware of the power of the artifacts, Ne Zha unintentionally killed the prince. The Dragon Lord could not China if Ne Zha stays alive. Ne Zha killed himself to protect his land, and Tai Yi, touched by his sacrifice, revived him and made him more powerful than ever before. Now Ne Zha is strong enough to find three other legendary warriors and to defeat the evil king Zhou, the last one of Shang-Yin dynasty, and to put a just ruler on the throne instead.

Fengshenbang is a traditional Asian-style RPG. Most of the game is spent fighting random enemies and gain experience points to level up. The turn-based combat is viewed mostly from first-person perspective, although you can see your characters on the screen when they are attacking. The simple battle system allows you to use physical attacks or cast magic. The interface of the game requires you to select actions from a menu, in  Dragon Quest style.</desc>

		<desc>Your starship is alive! A metamorphic creature that can transform from a huge flying insect into a metallic destroyer. Face squadron after squadron of alien fighters, marching ever onward towards a final confrontation with an all-powerful enemy.

This is basically a scrolling, shoot-it-if-it-moves, action game. As your ship scrolls up the screen, you fire on ships coming from the top of the screen. Occasionally, after ships have been destroyed, you can pick up a power up to increase you firing ability. At the end of each level is a boss you must defeat to move onward.</desc>

		<name>Garou Densetsu Special</name>
		<desc>Garou Densetsu Special (literally "Hungry Wolf Legend") is a pirated port of Fatal Fury Special by Hummer Team, made for the Famicom in 1995. This is a port of the SNES version.
This version includes 8 characters and four repeats of each: Kim Kaphwan, Tung Fu Rue, Wolfgang Krauser, Ryo Sakazaki, Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi and Mai Shiranui. All of the characters are playable. Like some Hummer Team fighting games, the difficulty can be changed on the title screen. Unlike the original game, the characters don't get their own stages, instead they go in a preset loop throughout the game. As well as this, some of the characters' original stages aren't present in this game.
The graphics are taken from the original game and downgraded. The music is mostly taken from there as well, but one song is remixed from Street Fighter IV, and the ending music from Kart Fighter is present here. The ending is a shortened version of the one from the original game.</desc>

		<name>Kart Fighter</name>
		<desc>This game can be purely considered the 'illegal' predecessor of Super Smash Bros., since it's, ironically, Street Fighter II with Mario Kart characters. All in all, it copies the mechanics of Street Fighter II in almost everything, starting from the moves and ending with combo system.

Like in Mario Kart, there is an overall of eight characters to choose from, starting with Mario, going through Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Koopa, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr. and, finally, Bowser, whom you have to defeat two times during the arcade play. Most of the character roster is being a huge bunch of shotoclones, with one of the few exceptions being Peach, who has Chun-Li's moveset, Koopa, who has some sort of a 'kamikaze' projectile and Donkey Kong who throws a ground projectile, similar to Terry's Power Wave.

The game has original sprites and music, although some graphics were obviously reused from such games as Little Nemo: The Dream Master and Wario Land 4, not to say about the use of the graphics from Mario games themselves.

Like in many games based on the same engine (along with NES Street Fighter II port by the same developers), this has the two-player mode, apart from the contrary belief, by pressing the A button on the second gamepad during player select sequence.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters 96</name>
		<desc>This is a fighting game based off KoF '96 by SNK, and includes 7 different characters. It appears to be based off Street Fighter Zero 2 '97, having several of the same issues that it has such as garbled sprites on the top of the screen during fights, two repeats of each character (this is the same case in SFZ2'97) as well as having numerous sound effects reused from it. Both games also use the same VS screen music. Unlike that game though, this has a difficulty setting, and retains the team mode that the actual King of Fighters games have. There are only 7 characters in this game, much fewer than the original game's roster. There's no POW bar in this game, unlike the original, making it play more like Street Fighter II. The ending is a cutscene of Goenitz being defeated, however it is in English, with one of the lines (FIGHTER KING OF FIGHTERS 98 I'M BACK TO TRAINING EVERY DAY AND I'M KICKING BUTT) randomly taken from the Fatal Fury Team's ending from the original game.</desc>

There are two major revisions of this game; one contains a final boss and ending, while the other is missing both and just loops infinitely. There are also two hacks of this game, called The King of Fighters 98 and The King of Fighters 99; each replaces the 7 in the title screen with a crudely drawn 8 or 9, and updates "Announcing the 1997 King of Fighters tournaments" in the intro to contain its respective year.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as bombs to create little explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.</desc>

		<desc>Honey Peach (also known as Mei Nu Quan) is a very simple rock-paper-scissors game in which the player competes against several increasingly skillful female opponents. The screen displays two hands, each representing a competitor, rapidly closing and opening fists. The goal is to press one of the three buttons corresponding to rock, paper, and scissors at the right time, stopping the movement and displaying the results. The women undress in three stages; the game is lost if the player has lost six times to the same woman.</desc>

		<name>Monster Truck Rally</name>
		<desc>Take the wheel of a monster truck through nine different events at a time or choose the rally and go through all of them. The nine events are hill climb, drag race, bog, car crush, tug-o-war, sled pull, draw bridge, donuts and the combo course.

In the hill climb, players race on a track comprised mainly of steep hills. The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,

Players can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.</desc>

Also at the beginning of the match with Shang Tsung, you can see Shang Tsung himself for a split second before it changes. However, the game plays much slower and almost all the sound effects are missing. This game also adds an invincibility setting in the options menu.
The game itself plays similarly to Cony's Street Fighter II Pro but the engine has been modified to resemble the original Mortal Kombat. Specials are done in the same way as Street Fighter II Pro by pressing a direction and both A and B. Similar to the original game, instead of holding back to block you hold down a button instead.</desc>

		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

Instead of being a simple compilation of card games like the previous two Poker games this game is actually a board game featuring various card games called King of Casino (said games can still be selected individually at the main menu however.) The story in this mode is about a guy named Jack who is invited to Las Vegas by its mayor to become a millionaire. The player travels the playing board by rolling a die which determines what game they can choose to play or come across one of several characters. The games that can be played are King Poker (standard poker), Poker (Texas Hold 'Em), Blackjack, and 13 Cards. After reaching a particular financial milestone (every $200,000) the game will play a cinematic of a man clapping in front of a city then posing to show one of several flying objects. They are in order a UFO, a witch, a helicopter, and a blimp with the word "KING" on it. When you become a millionaire the game will automatically cut to the ending which features credits.</desc>

The game includes two difficulty settings and a password feature. Rangers begin stages wielding the standard Ranger Gun which can be replaced with the character's corresponding Legendary Weapon. At the end of each stage, the player will confront one of Evil Witch Bandora's henchman and ultimately Bandora herself. Between stages Dragon Ranger offers players the chance to play one of three minigames. These consist of a trivia game where Bandora will ask the player questions about the TV series, a Pong-style game between Daizyuzin and Caesar, and a hot potato-style game between Zyutei Daizyuzin and Lamy.

		<name>RumbleStation 15 in 1</name>
		<desc>The Rumble Station is a NES-on-a-chip based Famiclone system that contained 15 games. It includes every NES game developed by Color Dreams, as well as two Sachen games published by them. Color Dreams licensed out the games for use on the system. It was originally distributed by Systema in the United Kingdom, and by Pelican in the US under the name Game Station Arcade. (although the menu screen still said "Rumble Station")

At its heart the Rumble Station consists of a generic NES-on-a-chip micro-controller (a complete cloned NES on a single chip) with 15 games programmed into it. The system is the size and shape of a Dreamcast Game controller (without the window for a VMU), and is powered by either 4 AA-size Batteries or an optional 9V DC Power Supply (Sold Separately). The casing itself is blue, with a black panel where the window on the Dreamcast Controller once was.

The syste features jacks for Composite Video Output and Audio Output (2x RCA Connector - there is only Right-side Audio output).

		<name>Destiny of an Emperor</name>
		<desc>A role-playing game for the NES set within the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos that has spawned games on nearly every platform imaginable.  A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

The characters are stiff, and there are no extra features. Additionally, because of technical limitations, the overall difficulty of the game has become very high, and each opponent poses a significant threat.

There are only three characters to choose from: Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun.</desc>

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

		<name>Somari The Adventurer</name>
		<desc>Somari  the Adventurer is a Sonic the Hedgehog port for the NES, with a twist. Instead of Sonic, the player controls Somari, which can be described as Mario in Sonic's shoes, literally.

Overall, the gameplay is quite faithful to the original game, though Somari can spindash (by pressing down and A or B), a feature fist introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Somari has to collect rings, but unlike in Sonic, if he's hit by an enemy, only three rings will fly out of him, no matter how many rings he's currently carrying.

The level sequence is faithful to the original game, with the exception of the Scrap Brain level, which wasn't finished and thus was removed from the final product. The level design ins't faithful to the original version, with constant changes throughout the game. The items and monsters are the same found in the original game, and the music is as faithfully translated to the NES as possible, with some tempo variations.</desc>

Now it's up to Jackie Chan to follow after the Sorcerer and battle his minions in order to rescue his sister and save China.

Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu is a side-scrolling fighting game. Jackie's controls are one button to jump and another one to attack or be used in combination with a direction for a special attack. On his quest, Jackie must punch and kick his way past frogs, ninjas, birds and other enemies. Jackie can acquire special-moves such as the Tornado attack, the 180 degree spin kick, the 360 degree spin kick and the Sky Attack. Other power-ups include energy refills and bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Super Donkey Kong - Xiang Jiao Chuan</name>
		<desc>Super Donkey Kong - Xiang Jiao Chuan is a Donkey Kong Country bootleg for the Famicom. The developer is believed to be Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co with Liang Yi Productions as the publisher.

While this game takes many elements from Donkey Kong Country, it's more of an original game than a port. The player can only choose to be either Donkey or Diddy Kong and you play through the whole game with only one. They lose a life after three hits as opposed to one as shown in the top left. (Which is not displayed anywhere on the HUD.) A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running. It's also been noted that the Kongs themselves feel rather slippery when attempting to stop, especially when running.</desc>

		<desc>Hidden Chinese Chess is played as a standard Dark Chess / Banqi game, which in itself is a more informal variation of Chinese chess. It is played in the middle of a Chinese chess board with pieces placed inside the squares (instead of in the corners as in Chinese chess) facing down. Each player takes a turn to flip a piece, with any colored piece discovered to be that player's team. The pieces that are uncovered move one square each in the four cardinal directions (except for the cannons) to move or capture other pieces. Each player continues to discover pieces and tries to remove all of the opponent's pieces or capture the last piece.</desc>

  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

		<name>Bio Hazard</name>
		<desc>Based on Resident Evil for the PlayStation. The plot follows the original game scripts, although just Jill is a playable character and the game is in Chinese. This game impresses because of the small details. The beginning of the game brings the introduction of Resident Evil 1, originally a video, adapted to sprites.
There are two ROMs available; one of them freezes and makes the gameplay almost impossible in most emulators, but the second one (extracted from a WXN pack) doesn't freeze and works only in selected emulators. Also, the original cartridge doesn't have many bugs and the gameplay is completely viable. Unlike the original game, this port removes the Black Widow and Giant Snake boss battles. However, the Plant 42 boss is intact.
A Zapper or a generic pistol can be used to shoot the enemies during the battle screen.</desc>

		<desc>This is a port of the Mega Drive version. There are five levels, based on Anything but Tangerines, Inflated Head, Villi People, The Flyin' King and Udderly Abducted. The Puppy Love sub-levels are also included in this port. The player has infinite ammo and can use the Snot Backpack, but the whip does not seem to be usable in this port.
The graphics and music are taken from the original game and simplified. However, there are some graphical glitches and the music is not particularly faithful, but does seem fair for its type of soundtrack. Like many other Super Game ports, this game has no ending; after the player completes the final level, the game simply resets, although like Shin-Shin's port, this game finishes at Udderly Abducted.</desc>

		<name>Earthworm Jim 3</name>
		<desc>This game is a pirated port of the first Earthworm Jim game on Megadrive, and includes three different levels split into two parts each. Each half of each level has a boss to it. The different parts themselves are mostly distinguished by colour palette differences. The levels are based off New Junk City, What the Heck? and For Pete's Sake. Jim can attack with the whip and gun, and the weapon you use can be changed by hitting the SELECT button. However, the player is forced to use the whip when jumping and the the gun when hanging from something.</desc>

		<desc>English Pyramid is an adaptation of Sachen's Chinese game Middle School English also known as Dong Dong Nao II from 1989. The original version targets young Chinese school children trying to grasp the basics of English. This version released in 1991 was adapted for Korean school children and has been translated to Hangul! Quite an achievement if you consider the complexity of Hangul and that the game graphics are encapsulated in a 128Kbits memory.</desc>

		<desc>Open Production provided the software for the Family Noraebang, a Famicom clone &amp; karaoke combo manufactured by Daou Infosys and distributed by Daewoo. (But the cartridge was also sold as a standalone for use with any other Famicom compatible.) With 56 songs the initial selection paled against its direct competitor by HiCom, but Daou offered various song packs which could be inserted into a special slot in the Karaoke cart. It is unknown how many of those packs were actually produced, though at least two could be spotted in an advertisement (40 songs each). The cart also included an FM sound chip and an additional audio jack to directly connect it to an amp.</desc>

		<desc>This game is a modified version of Ultimate League Soccer; instead of national teams, the game features teams from the Brazilian football league (with different characteristics than the original teams).

One of two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The "World Cup" championship let the player choose one of 8 Brazilian teams: Internacional, Flamengo, São Paulo, Vasco, Corinthians, Palmeiras, Fluminense or Santos. The "Olympic" championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: Internacional, Flamengo, São Paulo and Vasco. Each team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

		<desc>Master Higgins and his lover Tina were having a good time with their dinosaur friends on the peaceful Adventure Island. One day, suddenly a suspicious shadow appeared in the sky and kidnapped the dinosaur friends one after another. The animals of the island were brainwashed by the suspicious shadows, and the terrain of the island was completely changed. Master Higgins embarks on an adventure to rescue the kidnapped dinosaurs and restore the peace of the island.

Adventure Island IV marks a notable departure from previous games in regards to the gameplay, ditching the linear arcade-style platforming in favor of a more open-ended, exploration-oriented game with light RPG elements, more closely resembling later games in the Monster World series.</desc>

		<desc>Jang Doo Jin's Baduk Clinic: First Lesson (aka Korean Igo) is a Korean educational game teaching the basics of Go developed and published by Golden Bell. The player can either follows lessons or play a versus game with another person.

This is the only Famicom title entirely in Korean. Since Hangul is an agglutinative language with thousands of possibilities and this game being text heavy, the developpers had to find a way to generate the text graphics on the fly rather than storing all existing combinations in the game CHR data.</desc>

It's a game of strategy and concentration to ultimately "outflank" your opponent. The object of the game is to flip your opponents discs to your colour, ending up with a majority of discs on the board bearing your colour.

To "outflank" means to trap one or more of your opponents discs in the middle of two of yours.

Three skill levels against the computer or a friend.

		<desc>Go North to the Arctic and meet Mr. Penguin. He is one of the great pioneers of the icy climate and if I may say so, a survivor.
His game is collecting diamonds scattered in the coldest corners of the globe. Guide Mr. Penguin through each round and help him with his diamond collection.
You must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.
Hang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!</desc>

		<name>Rocman X</name>
		<desc>Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.
Rocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.
The first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.</desc>

		<name>Sheng Huo Lie Zhuan</name>
		<desc>The end of the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty, which has ruled China in 13th and 14th centuries, is near. People rebel against the tyrannical regime of the emperors. The Holy Flame Society, the most persistent of rebel organizations, is being heavily persecuted by the government, and its leader, the Grand Master, has disappeared. The player takes control of the "Little Master", who must find allies to strengthen the Holy Flame Society and eventually overthrow the rulers of the country.

Considered the first major Chinese (Taiwanese)-made role-playing game for a console, Sheng Huo Lie Zhuan ("Tale of the Holy Flame") is a rather basic RPG of the Japanese template. The player navigates the hero and subsequently joining party members over the top-down "world map", entering towns and other areas represented by icons. In towns, it is possible to rest, chat with the townspeople, and buy supplies. Enemies attack the party randomly. The player must choose which characters to use before every battle. The turn-based engine, menu-based command input, and automatic leveling up are handled the same way as Japanese RPGs of the time.</desc>

A fan translation patch was released in 2018 to make the game playable by English speakers.

You can choose to play alone, against another player or in story mode. In 1 player mode, the goal is to clear the whole board while in other modes, you must make as much point as possible to go to the next stage. 2 pieces must be joined with less than 3 turns to remove them from the board.</desc>

		<desc>Silver Eagle is a 2D overhead action game reminiscent of Metal Gear with less stealth and more action, in which you walk around a dungeon shooting down enemies as an US American soldier. Worlds are divided on rooms, each one with several medals which you have to collect before advancing to another one. Rooms are filled up with various types of enemies (shooter, grenadier, bomber, etc.) and labyrinths, providing a gradual challenge on medal collect. You can walk and shoot only on the four basic cardinal points, having a special power (grenade), which damages and kills all enemies on the screen.</desc>

The player can choose from 4 characters: Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile and Zangief. There is also Vega (M. Bison in Western territories) as the final boss, although his name is misspelled as "Viga" in this game. They all have their moves (although Zangief's Spinning Piledriver seems to be missing). Like in the original version, the player fights through the other selectable characters (here in a preset order), eventually reaching the final battle with M.Bison/Vega. The player only gets one continue, unlike the official game.</desc>

		<desc>Super Pang was originally an arcade game released by Mitchell in 1990 in Japan. The game was then ported to the SNES console by Capcom, and released as Super Buster Bros. in 1992. Before that happened, Sachen and Thin Chen Enterprise released this unlicensed port, manufactured and distributed by themselves for the Famicom system in 1991. Unlike the original arcade game and its licensed port, the game does not feature co-op play, as the players simply take turns. Also missing from the original are the different modes of play (Panic mode and Tour mode).</desc>

The music is ripped from a GB Pokemon game and is annoying. Unlike any official Zelda game, this is a turn-based RPG with random battles. But it appears to follow the minish Cap plot. Like Link's Awakening remake (NES), I think this one also a pretty terrible game.</desc>

		<name>Super Pang</name>
		<desc>Super Pang was originally an arcade game released by Mitchell in 1990 in Japan. The game was then ported to the SNES console by Capcom, and released as Super Buster Bros. in 1992. Before that happened, Sachen and Thin Chen Enterprise released this unlicensed port, manufactured and distributed by themselves for the Famicom system in 1991. Unlike the original arcade game and its licensed port, the game does not feature co-op play, as the players simply take turns. Also missing from the original are the different modes of play (Panic mode and Tour mode).</desc>

Taiwan mahjong also has some its own unique regional set of rules. This game features two game modes. One is the regular version of Taiwan mahjong and the other is a timed version where the player is only given 10 seconds to make each one of their their moves.</desc>

You must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.
Hang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!</desc>

		<name>Rocman X</name>
		<desc>Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.
Rocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game.
The first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.</desc>

		<name>Mahjong Trap - Si Cuan Ma Que</name>
		<desc>One of several Mahjong solitaire games released by Sachen. Mahjong Trap - Si Cuan Ma Que is based on the popular solitaire game Mahjong Tiles, a game adapted by Joseph Babcock to the United States around the end of the First World War. However, Mahjong did originate in China, but its adaptation in the 1920s spread like wildfire across Britain, the United States, and Australia, among other countries. Hacker International's version, Shisen Mahjong - Seifuku Hen, has added erotic themes. In the game the player(s) tackle six difficulty levels with three levels in each that reveal their own set of erotic images upon completion of each stage. The game's notable in that it features voice clips (although low quality) and is very difficult, partially due to the lackluster programming. There's a two-player mode in the game where if a connection isn't made in time, a sound clip will play and the other player will take control. This is probably the best way to tackle the game, considering how complex the puzzles get.</desc>
